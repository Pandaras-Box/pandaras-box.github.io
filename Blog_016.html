<h2>EGX is over! #Tranzfuser gamedev grand finale!</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small>I'd hoped to update everyone on our progress as each day of the show went by but, frankly, the pace of the last few days was way too fast to process anything to a useful level, so I thought it 
better to spare you all the delirious stream of thought ramblings of myself and the team and to, instead, collect our thoughts first.<br/><br/>

I'm noting this down on the flight from Birmingham up to Scotland (myself and Ben are off to explore there and catch up with a friend since we're already on this side of the Irish Sea, while leaving the 
rest of our fellow NI contingent <span class="text-success">(E.N: including your friendly neighbourhood editor)</span> to catch a flight home) on the Monday after EGX wrapped, so everything should, 
hopefully, be fresh in my mind. <br/><br/>

Let’s deal with the elephant in the room first: unfortunately (as you may already know if you've been following our Twitter the last couple days) we didn't make it into the final stage of #Tranzfuser, as 
competition with our fellow 16 teams was fierce so we missed the fast-track through UK Games Fund. Our proverbial (Panda-themed) hat is, however, going straight back into the ring for the scenic route when 
the opportunity arises in the coming weeks. <br/><br/>

We're in far from negative form as we leave, however, as feedback on Project Leitmotif was overwhelmingly positive, and getting our combat system into the hands of the Tranzfuser judges and the droves of 
attendees lead us to find a much broader appeal than we anticipated for our genre-hybrid of a baby. <br/><br/>

Most of the critique we received lined up with our own plans, with the major negative criticisms being tied into what is intended to be our next major milestone (a easy to pick up introduction that eases 
players in) and the severe difficulty of a couple of motifs in the demo build (in an ‘un’related note: Hi Dicky!). <br/><br/>

On the flip-side, praise was abundant for our concept, controls, character design (thanks Ciaran & Dervla - I'll give her a proper introduction finally next week I swear, just know those two have become a 
great tag-team already) and the various unique aspects we've developed. This praise came from everyone, small children through to the industry vets involved with judging, with the former in particular 
delighting us as we had been slightly worried the complexity of some features would seem daunting. Getting high praise for the humour in our community output (vlogs and blogs) was something of a shock 
though. We thought we’d been nothing but stoically serious in these.<br/><br/>

David & Dicky seemed suitably ready for a few days rest, and, with myself and Ben not due home until later in the week, we'll not be having a proper stock taking of each of our EGX experiences or short-term 
goals for the project until we return to work proper on Monday, so I think it'd be cool to hold off on discussing the rest of the show in detail until then (with some special guest writing from the guys). <br/><br/>

To help tide you over until then, here's a dose of Blatant Pandaring (apologies for the lack last week!) and adieu :):  <br/>
