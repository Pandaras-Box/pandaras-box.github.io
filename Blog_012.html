<h2>Feature Creep & the Mystery of the Lost Mechanics</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> Every project has core goals to start. With games, these often (assets aside) end up being the key pillars of development, focused around the major mechanics of the title. Surrounding these, 
however, are often numerous smaller, seemingly inconsequential elements or mechanics that, while not crucial for the game to “work” as intended, usually add depth and more fun to the overall experience 
for the player. We’re at a great point currently where we have one of those pillars, and now we’re looking to add more variety around it. Thus, it only makes sense to take a step back and look at a marvelous 
thing that can occurs when this happens: feature creep.  <br/><br/>

What do I mean by feature creep? Well, googling it gives this (aptly) overlong explanation: “Feature creep, creeping featurism or featuritis is the ongoing expansion or addition of new features in a product, 
such as in computer software. These extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and can result in software bloat and over-complication rather than simple design.” (thanks Wikipedia :P) Want 
that as a more game-centric explanation? It’s when more “cool” ideas than are necessary get piled into a game, often just because they sound cool. It can also be applied to writing, for example when writers 
commit to writing brief pieces, and they grow and grow and grow into a massive blob of words <span class="text-success">(E.N: Now where have I seen that before…)</span>. Put another way, instead of too many cooks, 
this is a problem of too many ingredients spoiling the broth. <br/><br/>

With Project Leitmotif, it has been ridiculously tempting to let feature creep just take over for a while and see what works and what doesn’t, but, particularly as deadlines loom, there has to be a limit. 
It has been particularly notable for us because we did reach that natural pause at the end of #Tranzfuser, so we had the breathing room to take a step back, look at the project and come up with ways in 
which to expand and add to the current build. While many of these were aspects already planned back at the beginning, what would happen if a developer only ever used the ideas they had when a project began? 
Well, most games frankly would be pretty $#*! and stale!  <br/><br/>

A major pitfall tied into this whole process of generating interesting new things to include is the worrying potential that genuinely interesting mechanics could end up falling by the wayside, or, worse 
still end up in the game but get overshadowed by a glut of much less interesting stuff. It’s a fine balance that every dev team hopes to strike. For me, one of the greatest examples of a game walking that 
tightrope properly was the first Super Mario Galaxy. Looking past its quality as a game, (it’s excellent, sorry, couldn’t not say that at least) something it was not short of was ideas. For completionists 
there were new ideas arriving right up to the closing minutes of the game - seriously, the last level plays about with stuff other teams could build a whole game around! It’s a tactic of design that doesn’t 
always work, because it can mean elements can get lost, overshadowed or botched in the execution, but those wonderful nutters at EAD Tokyo managed to make even the relatively lesser ideas strike a chord. 
For those who played a lot of it, do you remember Spring Mario? Of course you do, it was an obnoxiously backwards power-up, but it was used sparingly and, as a result, ended up a as cute gimmick that made 
you laugh before going back to the core flow of play. To contrast with that, the long jump (performed while running by tapping the crouch button just before jumping) is used throughout the game, from the 
opening tutorial to the final level, and that’s fine too because it is super satisfying to JUST land on a far-off platform by the tip of Mario’s toes, or get caught in a spiral after leaping between the 
gravity fields of two or more planetoids.  <br/><br/>

The key thing to keep in mind is that, if a mechanic is vital to the overall flow of the core game, polish that until you can see the reflection of it in its reflection of your own eye (yes, that much). 
Similarly, if something is a cool gimmick for variety’s sake, but is still fundamentally just a gimmick? Go for it, but don’t dare let it overstay its welcome - we don’t want another example of GTA’s 
vehicle tailing sections on our hands <span class="text-success">(E.N: Same old CM. Busta! Straight busta!)</span>! We’ve been having plenty of concepts thrown about the office for how to improve upon the existing core of our prototype. 
Most of them get chucked in the bin as soon as they’re described to the rest of the team. Others however, the exciting ones, get nabbed and run with as soon as they can be mapped out in code. Trying to 
avoid letting these new-fangled thingamajiggers get in the way of previously planned, small but vital additions is something we try to keep in mind the whole way through any consideration and conceptual 
stages.  <br/><br/>

It’s certainly an intriguing topic to consider. When is a feature there for variety’s sake and when is it there because it’s something that should be core? When should new ideas take priority over 
pre-existing ideas, if they even should, or is there space for both? I’ll leave you all to mull it over though, as we’ve just been tasked with setting up our new, less temporary workspace in the brand-new 
CS building here, so I should probably stop typing and get back to helping shift desks around. I’ve probably bored you all enough at this stage anyways! :P <span class="text-success">(E.N: Can confirm)</span>
