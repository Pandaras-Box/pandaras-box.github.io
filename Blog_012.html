<h2>Running forward while looking back…</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> We gave ourselves a bit of a breather last week, (which happily coincided with the super lengthy 3 day Irish summer we’ve been gifted by Nature for 2016 (E.N: bah humbug)) but it’s back to 
work this week, and so we’re trying to hit the ground running again with today being the intended end of our broad planning phase for the coming pre-EGX month! We’re also delighted to announce that we’re 
in discussions to expand our team with a work experience student, hopefully leading to our art “lead” Ciaran actually having a sub-team to lead as a result, more on that next week though. <br/><br/>

While we’re of course focused for the coming weeks on refining our prototype further, looking to do has given us some time to look back on the past 3 months, consider what went well for us, what we would 
do differently and generally how the increase in team size for Pandara’s (compared with previous projects) shifted various dynamics. <br/><br/>

Time-keeping, and gaining a general solid working structure is something that was notably developed across the duration of #Tranzfuser and in fact led to the development of a system that we feel has come 
to work very well for us. As a group of individuals coming off the back of university commitments, some of the team had various times they were unavailable, which naturally led to needing a relative form 
of “flexi-time” suitable for the team (that also accounted for David’s preference of a later start and end to my preference for earlier ones, for example) while allowing for effective management of the 
project’s finances in an incentivised manner. This system, refined as we progressed, came to ideally suit the requirements of our team, and so is one which we will continue to use in the future. <br/><br/>

Gauging effectively realistic goals is something that, while rapidly improved upon throughout the course of the whole thing, required some lovely and unexpected hits by reality. That Nosculus Rift-based 
weaponised instrument smelling mini-game for one had to be cut late in development, primarily due to time-constraints but also due to the fact our test subjects kept passing out from the smell. Being 
serious though, I do feel that, even for the purposes of the month ahead, our goals and ability to adjust for change will be much more useful. <br/><br/>

When it comes to the negatives though, I guess our major concern is one of containment, with our truly failing to take sensible action when dealing with our most menacing of adversaries in development, 
the common flu! We’ve touched upon it before, of course, but it’s probably fair to say that this was our biggest issue throughout the duration, and I would hope we could find ourselves better equipped 
down-the-line to deal with both clearly migrating illnesses (such as the one halfway through the project that travelled around the whole team - multiple times, in some people’s case!) as well as those 
more out-of-the-blue… particularly when it meant we had in a couple of cases larger workloads assigned to team members who unexpectedly took ill at wonderfully inopportune moments. Contrary to this, we 
were successful in not letting change in venue impact our work in any meaningful ways, with our office space (due to the rebuilding of the Computer Science building of QUB that we’ve been using) changing 
4+ times over the past few weeks. This is something we jokingly noted in our 2nd vlog (#ShamelessPlug <br/>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYV05LGdVVM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>) <br/>but praise is due to the team for being happy to work on 
their feet in that respect.<br/><br/>

Now, though, we take these (arguably self-explanatory, simple even) lessons and look ahead, primarily at the 28 days before we leap-frog over the Isle of Man to Birmingham (good geography skills right?) 
but also to the broader goals that lie ahead of us for Project Leitmotif. We will hopefully allow these lessons to help us to keep focusing on the cool stuff - the evolving story, art, gameplay and inner 
workings of a project we hope the attendees of EGX (and fingers crossed those past that!) will get to experience and enjoy!
Oh wow, I kept that one “brief”, awesome, here’s some Blatant Panda-ring that we’ve tracked down to celebrate:  <br/><br/>
