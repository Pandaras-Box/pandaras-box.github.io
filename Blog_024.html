  <h2>Honors, honors everywhere!</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p><small> </small></p>

  <p><small>Good afternoon reader (making that plural feels cheeky after our time away), and welcome to another round of nonsense from our team of
    Ailuropoda Melanoleuca-loving <span class="text-success">(E.N: “Panda”. He means “Panda”.)</span> crafters of fun. As touched upon last week,
    the main distraction over the past 7 days was multi-personality event extraordinaire:<br>
  PlayMyDemo January 2017! ...<br>
  NI Game Dev Network's 4th Birthday! ...<br>
  Immersive Tech NI's "Biggest VR Local Multiplayer ever in NI" event! ...<br>
  or was it NI Game Awards 2016?! </small></p>

  <p><small> Yes, you guessed it (and without being asked to, to boot!), it was all of the above! Saturday evening/night, while of course being an excuse
    for all of us in the local industry an attempt to have some craic, was also a wonderful chance for us to take stock of the fact that as a (fairly) tiny
    region, we're not doing too bad in the whole “growth” thing. Collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/immersivetechni">@ImmersiveTechNI</a>
    to help bring their VR multiplayer showcase to fruition was a wonderful sight (I'm sure they're curious as to whether the 7 adjoining setups in one
    match was close to a public record in general) and there were some pretty cool demos on show including a couple of highlights from the preceeding #GGJ17.</small></p>

  <p><small>Most notable for me, however, were New 3DS title (great to see some handheld love from here) <a href="https://twitter.com/weemanstudios">Lifespeed
    from @WeeManStudios</a>
     <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://cdn.nintendonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lifespeed_new_nintendo_3ds_2.jpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     and <a href="https://twitter.com/FlaxenFlash">@FlaxenFlash</a>'s Inertial Drift. Both racers, with Lifespeed out this week on
    eShop and Inertial Drift still in development, but they couldn't be further apart in the genre if they tried! The former is a (visible)depth adoring
    "F-Zero"-like future racer, with an added touch of flight for good measure, (keep an eye out for it when it hits 3DS eShop this Thursday!)<br>
     Inertial Drift meanwhile meanwhile is a satisfying street racer where “realistic physics” are gleefully chucked out the passenger window in favour of
     a satisfying focus on the titular drifting, with steering and drifting handled via the left and right sticks. It scratches an itch much more akin to
     Ridge Racer or Split/Second than, say, Gran Turismo or Forza, and the different cars and tracks already on offer show great variety in highlighting the mechanics.
     While a one-person prototype, the driving already features that annoying level of slick polish I’d expect from the dev in question, having been the year
     behind him in university… I’m looking forward to seeing him build upon it more. </small></p>

  <p><small>Later in the evening were the Awards, and while they featured a small number of categories (4 plus one an honorary one), and were openly experimental
    for the region, I feel that they were a vital step in both promoting and recognising the progress the industry is making from the tiny bubble it understandably
    was a mere handful of years ago. Congrats of course to <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialGoat">Billy Goat Ent. with Her Majesty's Spiffing</a> cleaning up
    with both Studio of the Year and Game of the Year, and to the ever busy <a href="https://twitter.com/immersivetechni">@Kitty_Crawford</a> on her well deserved
    Community Award. I'd personally like to highlight the Rising Star Award though, won by <a href="https://twitter.com/LoneWolf2056">Prism Studio's
      Stephen Ferguson</a> a category that I feel is particularly relevant here, in a rising industry. Working on an original IP now, this guy is one of the brains
      behind both Portal Stories: Mel, & VR, something I am ashamed to not have realised considering how brilliant Mel is! My lack of realisation is one of the
      main reasons this award stuck out for me, as I feel that if, next year and beyond, these awards continue, with the focus being on getting across the entire
      variety of works happening here and not just the better publicised works, something I do believe will happen, then it could become both a cool thing to attend
      and an overall boon to the industry. I certainly look forward to seeing how the event evolves in the years to come! </small></p>

   The NI Game Awards weren't the only notable Honors of the weekend however, as Ubisoft continued its slow but successful assault on "accepted" online
     MP conventions with the Closed Beta of Knights/Viking/Samurai melee wonder, For Honor. 12 distinct heroes (9 in the beta) providing notable changes in gameplay
     balance, suiting a variety of playstyles. Available to try were its 1v1 & 2v2 duels, which highlighted the nuances of its intuitive tri-directional
     block/parry/attack combat, as well as the breathtaking 4v4 mode, Dominion. Ubisoft rather intelligently bundled 3 additional invites along with access to the Beta,
     and across the 3 evenings  this weekend I was joined by our own Dicky, Red Spear's Matt and <a href="https://twitter.com/CptCorallis">@CptCorallis, the writer at
       GeekErrant</a> (chosen as they were fortunate enough to be in a game of Overwatch with me as the email came through :P) You've heard me rant enough about my joy
       with their earlier title, RB6: Siege, and probably too many other FPS titles in the past, so I'm sure you'll be as glad as I am to hear that a new genre will be
       nabbing some of my downtime, sooner rather than later too if I hear the singleplayer manages to capture the MP's quality and justify the "AAA" pricing of the
       base game (wonderfully, the RB6 model of free gameplay updates in tandem with paid immediate access to new characters and cosmetics is the DLC model on-show
       ahead of its Valentine's Day launch). From a development perspective, the game is inspiring in many ways, which I'll likely end up going into more detail another
       time, but safe to say the 4 of us were impressed, especially with Dominion. The sense of scale, accomplished through the use of varying camera angles, AI grunts
       (akin to Titanfall for example) and a fantastic art direction that impressed even on performance-focused (lower) graphics settings. Above all else, the key is
       that we all had super fun playing it, and are eagerly refreshing our inboxes to see if Ubi's other upcoming 4 person co-op experiment, Ghost Recon: Wildlands,
       will also present itself to us for “beta testing”. If we get access I hope to use it as a way to (have fun, but also) examine the different ways game design can
       differentiate co-operative play, specifically what works and doesn't.
     </small></p>

  <p><small> Once again, we hope that we've provided something that was an interesting read, and if you missed the Closed Beta, some encouragement to check out a new
    game (there should be an Open Beta before it launches to check out too, so you won't have to just take Dicky and I's word for it). Thanks for reading, and adios
    until next week! </span></small></p>

  <p><small> Blatant Panda-ring this week probably visualises well our skill while playing For Honor:

  <p><small>TL;DR: NI Games industry, awards, For Honor</small></p>
