<h2>The calm before the storm (& some @PlayOverwatch after work), also known as the week without major news...</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> Every project has it, the duration may vary, but there will always be a timeframe between one significant
 milestone and the next, with work ‘feeling’ like it hasn’t quite kicked back into gear. For #Tranzfuser and Pandara’s Box,
 that timeframe is now, with the review last week, and a lot of our development reaching a ‘merge’ point at the same time. 
 Even the blog this parallels this, as this is the first week where the planned schedule of content had to be put on pause 
 s certain things need to slide into place before I can go into more detail on them. Instead, I present some updates on 
 where we are headed next, both geographically (Pandara’s Box on tour?) and in regards to the project. </small></p> 
 
<p><small> This week in particular finds the office much quieter than usual, with us telecommuting for two days as our usual workspace
 is closed as a result of something to do with “that colour that rhymes with nothing <span class="text-success">(EN: Doorhinge? Syringe?)</span>” 
 (steering clear of local politics for the blogs as best we can ;P). Following that, I personally am off to <a href="https://Twitter.com/DevelopConf">@DevelopConf</a> 
 in Brighton with <a href="https://Twitter.com/Ghostlyy">@Ghostlyy</a> (the plague carrier mentioned last week from <a href="https://Twitter.com/RedSpearGames">@RedSpearGames</a>) at stupid o’clock on Thursday morning
 to meet with some of our fellow #Tranzfuser folks for the craic and, hopefully, some interesting talks and chats at the 
 #IndieDevDay there. It’s an exciting opportunity for us to head over to, so big thanks to the <a href="https://Twitter.com/UKGamesTalent">@UKGamesTalent</a> crew for providing 
 us with passes for the day there. With our return flight not being until the Friday morning, we look forward to any
 post-conference shenanigans that may end up occurring, by which of course I mean ‘networking’ <span class="text-success">(E.N: Slacker.)</span>.</small></p>
 
 <p><small> Speaking of fellow #Tranzfuser folks, shoutout to <a href="https://Twitter.com/Keevahh">@Keevahh</a> who surprised us late last week with a drop-in visit. It was fun to 
 get chatting to someone from another team based out of a different hub, and it was particularly cool to discover that we (Pandara’s Box and Red Spear)
 are not the only local people on a #Tranzfuser project! We wish all those from <a href="https://Twitter.com/ColdSunStudios">@ColdSunStudios</a> well with their graduation next week. 
 Our own team should be back to normal strength from Friday on, potentially with an added @Ghostlyy dozing in the corner! </small></p>
 
<p><small>As I mentioned above, a part of this week’s work will be collating what has come before, 
uniting the various systems to provide a more coherent whole as we begin the back half of the programme. More interestingly 
though, we’ve been playing about with “abilities” in the game, the more interesting non-standard attacks that we intend to use 
to shake-up how the player interacts in combat with the rhythmic elements. This is where the various types of characters in your 
party will truly differentiate themselves, in second-to-second gameplay and in general tactical thinking.  </small></p>

<p><small>Tactical thinking is a concept that ties neatly into an entirely different game, one that will likely have bearing on design decisions
 the team will make in the coming weeks and months, <a href="https://Twitter.com/PlayOverwatch">@PlayOverwatch</a>. Taking a look back at the previous 4 weeks of my ramblings, I’m honestly surprised
 I’ve not namedropped it once yet, but with some wiggle room this week in terms of content for the blog, now is as good a time as any. Overwatch, 
 for the few reading who’ve not grabbed a go yet (who are you? Seriously, I’ve struggled to meet someone recently who hasn’t at least dabbled) 
 is a team-based first person shooter, with a huge and growing cast of characters (21 currently!) who all have unique spins and mechanics, 
 causing them to play significantly differently to suit pretty much every play-style you could think of for the genre. More impressively, 
 it manages to create a sense of teamwork, even among a team of strangers, something very few competitive games have managed. This makes it 
 particularly impressive that it also hasn’t developed a toxic element to the community so common in similar titles.  </small></p>
 
 <p><small> The title excels at placing fun at the forefront of gameplay, something we as a team try to keep at the forefront of any decisions we make. 
 The game also manages at the same time to remain (balancing issues aside, sudden death why?) a tense and competitive experience, carefully balancing on a 
 tight-rope few games manage, alienating neither one side nor the other of the community (and without seeing gambling elements rise up, *cough* TMartn, 
 Syndicate & CSGO *cough*). Another truly excellent thing to note about the way development has been handled is it’s approach to additional content. 
  While there is a ‘lootbox’ system similar to that seen in DOTA 2 or the more recent Call of Dutys, the content therein is entirely cosmetic. 
  All meaningful additional content, such as new game modes, characters or maps, are added to the game for no additional cost. While it could be 
  argued that the base game itself is a little on the pricey side, the array of additions and patches that have already landed in the few short months since launch, 
  combined with the variety of gameplay styles provided by the characters, it is an argument that seems to be rapidly losing its teeth. </small></p>
  
<p><small>So why all the Overwatch love this week then, you may be asking yourself. Quite simply, it has been an exemplary title for “How to do development right” 
  in too many ways to ignore. In a period in the industry where fundamentally broken games launch at ‘AAA’ price points, with swathes of content seemingly 
  cut and later added for the extra cost of the base price again and with marketing that directly makes fun of the target audience (don’t worry, anime fans, 
  we’ll be there for you on prom night), we feel that it’s worth highlighting when one of the ‘big’ publishers (don’t forget Blizzard are under the Activision
  umbrella now) puts something out that does good design, fun gameplay and treatment of the customers so, so right. (P.S. It’s High time you go F*#k yourself,
  McCree, Bastion, Toblerone, Gen... ;P <span class="text-success">(E.N: taste those delicious, delicious salty tears))</span></small></p>
  
<p><small> Thanks for reading, and don’t worry we didn’t forget… week 3 of our scheduled (yep! This part is scheduled!) “Pandas in Motion” content. 
This week, something a little different from your normal Panda fare:

<p><small>TL;DR: Calm week, Pandaras on tour, project accumulation, Overwatch! Overwatch! </small></p>
