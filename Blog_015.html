<h2>EGX begins!</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small>It’s currently 7AM, Thursday 22nd Sep and I’m sat on the top bunk of one of the three beds that Pandara’s and Red Spear (there’s six of us total) have claimed in a hostel on the outskirts of 
Birmingham’s city centre. I delayed this week’s ramblings until this morning so as to give my own (brief) thoughts ahead of the first proper day of EGX, now that it’s finally here.</br></br>

Getting to here was an event in itself, myself and Neal, Red Spear’s team lead, had to be here yesterday to confirm setup arrangements and everything seemed in order Tuesday evening in advance of our 
journey (along with David & Matt) the following morning at StupidO’Clock… then things started to look like they were going wrong personally. Booking train tickets to and from the NEC (where the event takes 
place) led to me locking myself out of using my card for online purchases, panic set in for no sensible reason (trains are the same price at the station) and sleep eluded me until an hour before we had to 
leave for the airport! </br></br>

My personal journey then... Overslept. Friends woken. Second laptop forgotten. Double-price taxi. Passport missing. Flight hassle-free. Arrive early. Too early? Search for city. Epic quest for hostel. 
Organise saving the second laptop. Check-in wait. Checked-in. Pillows?! Fixed. Return to event setup. Red Spear dilemma. Solved? Solved (Thanks Astro Manatee & mobile hotspots!). Ben & Dick arrive alive. 
They have the forgotten laptop. All is well. Train to tram. How do tram? Tram. Wrong stop. Tram again. Hostel. Order takeout. Calm. Where art thou takeout? Uncalm. 2 hours later. FOOD! Eat. Sleep. Wake. 
Write nonsense blog… oh wait, that’s it!</br></br>

If time permits, I’ll do a proper update on how the event is going before it ends, but for now, we’re excitedly, and sleepily, off to kick off the first day of EGX! Project Leitmotif will be on the 
showfloor (along with the other 14 games from Tranzfuser, and a scarily huge bunch of other stuff) all four days so come check it out if you get the chance! </small></p>
