<h2>Rise of the Fall of the Dawn of Project Leitmotif (i.e. #Tranzfuser is ending! Onwards we go… )</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> It’s genuinely baffling to me that this is the 9th piece of rambling text that I’ve produced, with help from @Thierymodela of course, for the bemused reading of all 5 of you (Hi mom!) since 
we at @Pandaras_Box embarked on #Tranzfuser. Somehow I think I’d failed to mention that, in fact, I had wanted way back during the development of #Slimebow to start putting a dev blog of sorts together, 
yet it took until we finished our degrees before it surfaced! <span class="text-success">(E.N: Jury’s still out on if it was worth the wait.) </span><br/><br/>

It’s certainly been an interesting 9 and a half weeks, and it all began with an idea. The idea was to bring together a group of acceptably useful people to see if they could become something more. <br/><br/>

I take a great deal of delight in how fortunate it was that the folks of @UKGamesTalent decided that 2016 should be the year they launch their pilot for a graduate scheme. While the risk was always there 
that we would end up as (occasionally bearded) guinea pigs, the work their team has put into keeping everything running smooth has been great and their being available wonderfully quickly when any queries 
have arisen has been of fantastic help. The scheme itself has been a great learning experience, and in some aspects a rude awakening for us as a team, much of this being linked to the nature of the process. 
What do I mean by that, I desperately hope you’re thinking? Well, in essence, Tranzfuser has been a concept and prototyping period of development on steroids! With the condensed time-frame, we’ve witnessed 
more milestones, redesigns and breakthroughs <span class="text-success">(E.N: and breakdowns, right Conall?)</span> of a technical, artistic and design-based nature than I would presume most early-stage 
projects would hope to see during the first few weeks of their team existing, let-alone the first few weeks of a project. <br/><br/>

With only a few days left, and plenty of stuff we want to get polished, I’m actually going to wrap up SUPER early this week, though you can look forward to a bumper edition next week, with Vlog 2 included!. 
Speaking of Vlog 2, there’s a reason why me and David do most of the writing for your reading pleasure, as we can highlight with glee now with some samples of what happens when we let Dicky give director’s 
notes for the Vlog’s script, along with our thoughts on the absurdity therein:<br/><br/>

<span class="text-info">Conall: (*Looks stressed as hell and as if he's just had no sleep for days except would be hyped up from lots of caffeine. Frequent sipping of caffeinated beverage hunched in corner 
with laptop, back turned, Pandara’s logo on hoody in focus… he turns around*)</span> (Writer’s Note: Well at least I’m hyped and not stre… dammit Dicky)<br/><br/>

<span class="text-info">David: (*Wearing red velvet bathrobes while sitting in an armchair in front of a fireplace and casually smoking a bubble pipe while holding a glass of drink in his other hand: 
"Ah hello, I didn't see you there. I see you've crawled your way back here. Very well, I suppose I could spare a minute about the progress and nearing conclusion of our project." Proceeds to blow bubbles 
out of pipe" Fades to black.*)</span> 
<span class="text-success">(E.N: He neglects to mention the source of these props. I can only assume he has them stashed in his room for some mystifying purpose)</span><br/><br/>


<span class="text-info">Ciaran: (*Casually weight lifting with large, ancient vases in each hand for a few seconds then pauses and turns to camera. Does the "Oh Yeah" nod and looks toward the 
camera.*)</span> (W.N.: He’s apparently so great he can look at the camera twice without looking away!)</span><br/><br/>


<span class="text-info">Dicky:(*Slowly and casually rises up from behind the desk like an elevator at an angle faced away from the camera before stopping turning to the camera smoothly. 
Says "Good morning".*)</span> <span class="text-success">(E.N: Apparently he rises like an elevator. Not like he’s riding an elevator, just, like an elevator. I hope I get to tie the rope around 
his neck to accommodate this)</span><br/><br/>

<span class="text-info">Ben:(*Casually wearing shorts and cap while on phone swiping up over and over again for a few secs before turning over to the camera. Says:" I like shorts! They're comfy and easy 
to wear."*). </span><span class="text-success">(E.N: I feel like this one would suit Dicky’s personality more. </span>W.N: Please don’t suggest Dicky wears shorts to work, I’ll feel completely redundant then!)<br/><br/>

<span class="text-info">Conall: (*Now looking chilled as heck and less hyped but seems fine and enthusiastic in a peaceful way.*) <span class="text-success">(E.N: Ah, the nirvana of project completion)</span>
<br/><br/>
This week’s Blatant Panda-ring is a perfect representation of my role as Project Lead (the human) and the four pandas I find myself corralling… our artist constantly trying to escape, sound guy 
(and wannabe director, see above) sleeping through most of it and our dev team trying to get things moving, with our editor preferring to be the hands-off type stepping in to help as needed:  <br/><br/>

<p><small>TL; DR: Project retrospective, crunch time, Dicky the directorial auteur</small></p>
