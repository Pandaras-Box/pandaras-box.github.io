<h2>Iceberg(s) Ahoy!! Digital and real barriers to work and play - #GGJ17</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p> 

<p><small>With our sudden return (in the eyes of you readers) with our last blog, I've been mulling over how to kick things off again, and, after recovering from the 
48hr madness of 2017's Global Game Jam, it occured to me that the main antagonistic element in GGJ17 Belfast's very own "R.H.Itanic" had a neat metaphorical parallel 
with the trajectory of the team sometime after our last 2016 update! </small></p> 

<p><small> So what nonsense is this now you think? Belfast didn't actually follow through so hard on its baffling affinity for the famed boating disaster that it had strapped itself 
to a raft and took the team into dangerous, ice-filled waters surely? Well of course not, but as I fired cannons into the things in (criminally overlooked - in favour of bug-fest Unity -
 AC:Black Flag) follow-up Rogue after the jam saw my team use them as obstacles, icebergs suddenly became the perfect way to explain where we'd vanished... For you see, the good (Box?) ship 
 Pandara sailed true as best it could, but unfortunately the dreaded Iceberg of Nofunds loomed ever closer, we plotted a new course, all was well, before a Piratical Armada of personal 
 circumstances emerged from the fog and crippled our honest vessel. We remained at port until the winter began to subside and repairs were completed as best possible, so here we are. 
 I felt it might be nice to mark our return with the website launch, and with GGJ17 so near the timing just worked out to combine things with a locally relevant politically satirical return 
 (more on that in a sec). Going forward, notable project updates will likely be smaller and less frequent as the team returns to juggling other means of financing themselves, we 
are very much in the planning stages of a new "normal" for Pandara's so expect an update on this in the future.</small></p> 

<p><small>Right, onto the fun stuff then, namely my escapade over the weekend down to <a href="https://Twitter.com/farsetlabs">@farsetlabs</a> 
 - thanks again to those who organised locally, I'll let Glenn, one of said organisers, do the shout-outs here:

<p><small> - for <a href="https://Twitter.com/GlobalGameJam">@GlobalGameJam</a>. The theme was "Waves" and I was working with two friends that had been on my uni course, Cathal and Conor, both attempting 
a game jam for their first time, having talked about it numerous times in the past. Considering the lack of experience we held as a team dealing with the unique nature of a lengthy game jam (and 
some prior commitments that took them away for stretches during the weekend!) I think our humourous, political satire with it's wonderfully evocative reward for surviving 100 seconds can happily
 go down as a success. Credit goes to Cathal for the truly poetic blurb found with the web build over at its current home here: 
 <a href="http://pandarasbox.com/RHITanic/index.html">R.H.Itanic!</a> <iframe width="767" height="545" src="http://ggj.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/game_content__wide/s3/games/screenshots/screen_shot_2017-01-22_at_15.47.49.png?itok=xW9SIRTs" 
style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true" ></iframe>
 <br> A fairly simple wave (heh) survival game where clicking creates shockwaves to knock away oncoming icebergs, said icy evils will both damage the ship on collision
  and speed up the chasing wave if they get past before being destroyed. Apart from our own work (to people not from NI, it's based on local humour/events) there was a wonderful variety on-show 
some of which can be seen <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2017/jam-sites/farset-labs-global-game-jam/games"> at the Farset hub site</a> with the personal standout for me being a game concerning
 screaming in co-op to escape a supermarket... yes really. Have a go at some of the bizarre but brilliant brain-children of Belfast if you have the time! :) </small></p> 
 
 <p><small> Before ending this week's blog, we have a special interruption! With this being our 23rd edition, providing a more in-depth look at why some of our team has been out-of-action 
 it is only fitting that we introduce our very own XXIII, Dicky Li, he who completes the Pandara's founders trio: 
 <br> <span class="text-info">Morning Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a while. Well actually more like it's my first entry for the blog but yeah, 
 I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas and New Years. Mine? Nothing out of the ordinary. Just been busy with working loads of shifts to save up money. 
 I had to replace my old CPU (AMD Phenom II x4 955 BE) which had done a great job but unfortunately kicked the bucket pre-Christmas. Due to budget constraints 
 My new replacement was just a slight step up from the previous one(AMD Phenom II x4 965 - better than nothing right?). <br>

Anyways now that my machine is back up and running, and my schedule has been freed up slightly, it's time to get back on track of glorious productivity.</span>
<br> While not neccessarily intending to be as ingrained into the blogs going forward as myself (or you know, that other guy...), I'm hoping to wrangle some more words from him a 
little sooner than in another 23 pieces! </small></p> 

<p><small> Anyways, back to the grindstone for some actual dev work! Of note before next time, NI is set to have its first local Game Awards event, organised by the 
wonderfully dedicated <a href="https://Twitter.com/AngieMcKeown">@AngieMcKeown </a> and it hopes to feature the region's largest ever local multiplayer VR session, so that's bound to 
gain a few laughs at least! Bye for now! <span class="text-info">Bye!</span></small></p> 

<p><small>TL;DR: Proper explanation explained?, GGJ17 - RHItanic!!, special 23 loving guest</small></p>
