<span class="s1"><b>I didn&#39t catch that&hellip;what exactly IS #Tranzfuser? (& some #E3 thoughts)</b></span></h1>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So we&#39ve alluded to being involved with Tranzfuser recently,
and I&#39ve been hoping to get our gamedev blog up and running finally in a regular capacity,
so I suppose explaining Tranzfuser is as good a way to start as any! We&#39ll wrap up this post with a few thoughts on all the E3 goings-on too. 
(The plan is these posts will land each week around the Tuesday/Wednesday mark going forward.) </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tranzfuser is a games development graduate competition that has been set up and funded by the lovely folks at
@UKGamesTalent (the same group of folks behind the @UKGamesFund if you&#39ve heard of that) that we applied for and successfully got placed in
last month. We pitched a new concept (more on that next week) and it went down well, so with a little bit of funding in our pot now,
we&#39ve been tasked with prototyping the concept within 10 weeks, beginning last Monday (6/6/16).
Throughout the scheme, we will be supported by mentors, all experienced in the industry, locally through @NIScreen.
In September we&#39ll be hopping over to England to demo the results of our hard work publicly, and, if it&#39s received well? There&#39s a fantastic prize&hellip;
namely, we get further funding to develop the prototype into something we can bring to market! Naturally the team is very excited to be back
in the saddle with our own IP, and we&#39re looking forward to revealing the concept and what we&#39ve worked on already in the coming weeks.</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before that though, we&#39ll wrap up the blog this week with what&#39s caught our attention this week in the industry
- it being #E3 week, there&#39s a lot more than I&#39d expect in later blogs. You may have caught my #livetweeting of the reveals on our Twitter feed
during the conferences but I thought that, given a few hours to process the last couple of nights of announcements, we&#39d take a run through the
titles that have caught the eye of the team (at least those of us who caught the news so far).</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, a quick shoutout to @RareLtd with #SeaOfThieves, looks very cool and our own Keith @Im_KStocky has been
over there working on it for his placement year - well done, Keith! </span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">David so far has been fairly reserved with what has caught his eye across the show, cautiously optimistic with
Ben and myself about #WatchDogs2, the lighter tone and greater freedom in application of &quot;hacks&quot; being notable. He also noted interest in
#HaloWars2, #DeadRising4, Ghost Recon Wildlands (more on that below) and #Dishonored2. Steep from Ubisoft is his personal highlight thus far,
due to it having been a while since a decent looking snowboarding game was released, the genre being fairly unpopulated and, well, the snow
effects being &quot;purdy&quot;! His take on it is that it looks like a fun cross between the freedom of movement of SSX and Just Cause 3 (and, of course,
the snowsports angle).</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similarly reserved, Ben was nonetheless happy to see the return of #CrashBandicoot as more than just simply a
Skylanders-related headline-grabber, with a remaster of the classic @NaughtyDog developed trilogy being announced. The #SpiderManPS4 reveal,
along with @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN&#39s return with Dead Stranding (and @wwwbigbaldhead to boot!), were notable for him (as well as Dicky and myself),
and Kojima&#39s entrance during Sony&#39s conference felt like a wonderful #F**kKonami after the horrible stuff that came out of that publisher
over the last year or so. Ben is also intrigued to see what comes of #FalloutVR, gave a suitable &quot;frak yea!&quot; to South Park: The Fractured But
Whole and was happy to see more Titanfall, particularly now that this sequel has single-player and &quot;isn&#39t a DLC fest like
Battlefield 1&quot;.</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much more broadly excited was Dicky, despite his thinking he hadn&#39t been interested in all that wide a variety.
Along with the other guys, Dicky liked the look of Steep, Dishonored 2, GR: Wildlands, South Park and Dead Rising 4. Further zombie-killing
caught his eye with State of Decay 2 and #DaysGone (&quot;Sons of Anarchy meets Walking Dead&quot; by my reckoning, although it&#39s hard to judge at this
stage if it&#39s free-roaming or scripted set-pieces). @Obsidian delighted him with #Tyranny and the suggestion of huge variety of choice in
Detroit: Become Human impressed. Also of note for him were #Aragami, Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 3 and #WeHappyFew (gotta agree with him on this
particularly).</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With Ciaran away, that just leaves myself, so I&#39ll start off with #Ghost ReconWildlands (see? I said I&#39d return to
that). After an impressive debut last year at E3, the game caught the attention of the entire team this year. Suggesting a similar freedom to
tackle missions similar to one of Ubisoft&#39s more recent Tom Clancy titles (Splinter Cell: Blacklist), the game presents a vast landscape with
a use of squad mechanics (or co-op) that looks genuinely meaningful and, more importantly, fun. Also from Ubi, #ForHonor and sequel to the
delightful Grow Home, #GrowUp (yay!). </span><p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Across the rest of E3 thus far, EA&#39s conference seemed to falter as a presentation, but I&#39m hopeful for Mass
Effect, and the gameplay of Battlefield 1 looks visceral, if oddly fast-paced for a WW1 title. Bethesda&#39s presentation brought a strong showcase
to the table, while Microsoft&#39s was strange. Two different consoles (not seeing the point in the Xbox One S if #Scorpio is next year) and a focus
on all their exclusives hitting PC as well as Xbox (#PCMasterRace :P).</span><p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That leaves Sony, with a genuinely excellent and exciting conference along with a solid lineup of titles, with the
live orchestra being a great starting point, bringing greater immersion to the entire show. Other than what&#39s been touched upon above, they also
showed more of the impressive #HorizonZeroDawn, finally gave #TheLastGuardian a release date(!), and, in general, made me much more open to the
idea of picking up a PS4. Of particular note were the titles that surprised by subverting people&#39s expectations. #InfiniteWarfare returned after
a, frankly, limp reveal, more than making up for it with an impressive gameplay demo that will likely change many opinions by showcasing a
wonderful similarity to #BattlestarGalactica, particularly in the space combat (those ships may as well be called Vipers), and fun-looking
grapple hook (see also, Titanfall 2, for all your grappling needs) and zero-g mechanics. Similarly, the new Resident Evil looked downright
chilling, like a reborn &quot;PT&quot;/Silent Hills until that Resident E(VII)L Biohazard logo appeared.</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the showfloor opening in a few hours and only a few reveals likely left, E3 (from an enjoyment standpoint)
was pulled back from the fire by a packed #PlaystationE3 conference. All that&#39s left now is for @Nintendo&#39s (90 minute!!) Legend Of #Zelda live
demo to live up to expectations tonight for us to be happy (well me and Ben for that one really).</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That&#39s it for Pandara&#39s Box first, and likely lengthiest, blog. Next week, we will talk about what exactly we&#39re
working on (Hint: we&#39re calling it #ProjectLeitmotif for now).</span><p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">TL;DR: We&#39re funded to make games, E3&#39s exciting and ending soon.</span><p>
