<h2>Switching things up in a Strange, Immersive (tech) manner</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small>New hardware often reshapes the games industry in significant ways and whether it’s a controller, peripheral, leap in power or another gimmick, new (sometimes better) ways to play and 
make games usually accompany it. Following PlayMyDemo the other week, I received an invitation to attend the upcoming Immersive Tech NI launch event (with VR and the like) and last week saw Nintendo 
finally reveal their newest entry into the hardware field, so I thought it as good a time as any to have a little ramble about hardware’s effects on development over the past few years.<br/><br/>

Before getting into the new stuff, I felt it prudent to highlight the changes (or broad lack of) that the ‘current’ generation brought with it. Power-wise, change was much less noticeable than past 
leaps, and the notable gimmicks involved handhelds passively trading information (put to excellent use with Nintendo’s Streetpass and, to a less notable extent, in Sony’s near app), Nintendo failing 
to convey the gimmicks and options the WiiU had (confusing everyone in the process), and Toys-to-life exploded, bridging the toy and game mediums in a way that tapped perfectly into many kids 
(big kids, like myself, included) fascinations with both. On the whole though, lasting innovations were in short supply, but it seems like that could be changing.<br/><br/>

I’ve talked about it before, but it feels like VR is going to stick around this time. Locally, we have the aforementioned Immersive Tech NI trying to galvanise those interested in working with the 
medium. After having a launch party, their inaugural hackathon will provide the exciting chance for a bunch of devs to try and innovate with the tech in general (not just in games), but more general 
use means more experience with the platform, which means more experience to apply to games development on the platform. <br/><br/>

Elsewhere, we have new dedicated gaming hardware on the horizon, with the Playstation 4 Neo and the upcoming Xbox “Project Scorpio” continuing down the path of boosting power, in a smaller increment 
than a full generational leap, making it the first major standalone ‘mid-gen’ leap home consoles have seen! This presents a new, PC-like, upgrade path for future Sony/MS devices. Speaking of PCs, 
tech has progressed to such affordability for high quality devices that the aforementioned ‘mid-gen’ in the console sector was needed to attempt to achieve parity.<br/><br/>

Nintendo, however have Switch-ed (Get it?) tack to tackle the same issue, that of remaining relevant, (particularly after the issues in branding and hardware that the WiiU had) with arguably the 
first true hybrid of handheld and console gaming devices. Seemingly otherwise a relatively gimmick-free device, and clearly aimed in it’s 3 minute elevator pitch at ‘young professionals’ 
(heh, like us?) with Nvidia using their improved chip-making skills to provide the device with the follow-up to their Shield’s Tegra X to (in theory) allow for a ‘current-gen’ experience on the 
big screen and on the go. The whole setup seems sensible, but in an exciting way, so it’ll be very intriguing to see how it all plays out, with my only concern being the handheld battery life.<br/><br/>

With this discussion, we've been talking about how the new hardware opens up whole new worlds of immersion. On the theme of opening up new worlds, the latest movie from the well-oiled Marvel 
juggernaut, Doctor Strange, landed this week and the team, along with some of our office sharers, Shallow Sky Studios, went out to see it. A trippy, fun and visually stunning film that certainly 
got us thinking about new ways to mess with player’s minds when it comes to visuals, and about how things ‘should’ look!<br/><br/>

All in all, it looks like we could be entering an exciting time for games, with the hardware providing the ability for developers to make content without power as an issue, and new, but not innovative 
for innovation's sake, ways to play, so we’re excited. However it turns out, that’s all for this week, so we’ll finish it off with our regular dose of Blatant Pandaring: <br/>
