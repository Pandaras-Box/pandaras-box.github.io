  <h2>Romance in games? Nah. Let’s talk relationships between players in video games instead </h2>
  <p></p>

  <p><small> </small></p>

  <p><small>Even if it’s tenuous at best, with today being Valentine’s Day, it would be rude to not find some possibility of linking our weekly nonsense to this, the most commercialized of yearly 
  debacles. While romance in games is certainly an interesting topic, it’s not really one I feel I could present a fresh take on at present, so I thought I’d instead approach my initially planned 
  discussion on co-op in video games from a themed angle instead.<br/><br/>

When it comes to designing and developing games, often the bulk of the parts in development aren’t individually going to be all that maddening (at least once you’ve settled on which mechanics you want 
to include), and designing worlds, stories and levels for single player experiences follow a similar path of being difficult to refine, certainly, but getting a rough version of your creative vision is 
usually more a case of time spent working than anything else. With multiplayer and cooperative experiences however, it becomes much trickier to create any form of lasting, meaningful engagement from 
players for many reasons. One of the most difficult considerations is that of the random element unique to these types of games and game modes, that of the relationships formed (both brief and lasting) 
between players. <br/><br/>

“Emergent narrative” is a term that’s been  bandied about quite a lot recently, especially when it comes to multiplayer games development. The hope seems to be that providing the players with the 
right combination of tools and mechanics will cover the cracks on any lacking areas within the pre-built narrative created by the team. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing - far from it, in fact - 
as it can often lead to some of the most uniquely wonderful experiences in games, or just some good humour from players (case in point: <br/>
<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FUNILADGaming%2Fvideos%2Fvb.659974074026473%2F1467169543306918%2F%3Ftype%3D3&show_text=0&width=400" 
width="400" height="400" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>).<br/><br/>

However, the emergent narrative in multiplayer and co-op in many cases relies heavily on the pre-existing relationships, often those outside of the games themselves, that the players have with one 
another… which, should players not be in particularly imaginative moods, or just tired for example, can lead to a more lackluster experience. <br/><br/>

I’d like to go into a broader discussion (maybe next week) on how games craft these connections successfully (or otherwise) with particular focus on mine (and Dicky’s) recent experiences with a few 
co-op games. In particular I hope to look at those experiences in which those provided tools to create unique and fun experiences upon repeated plays with different people, ended up feeling far too 
quickly as if the well was drying up and we’d seen all there was far too soon! For this week however I’ll have to leave you all there. If you’re wondering why? It’s because of a new professional 
relationship I find myself in, <a href="https://Twitter.com/coffeeboxgames">@coffeeboxgames</a>(don't worry, aside from video editing and game development, I plan on rectifying their relatively, umm
poor I guess is (politely?) the best way to put it, web presence :P) have drafted me to work a few days a week for the near future on a number of their projects, particularly involving those most 
directly tied into their co-lead, <a href="https://Twitter.com/Bellulargaming">@Bellulargaming's</a> ongoing love/hate connection to World of Warcraft! Exciting work lies ahead with that 
(as well as our own ongoing projects) so expect to hear more on that in the coming weeks! Happy Needlessly Red-themed Day to you all!  <br/><br/>

I also bid you farewell with some Blatant Panda-ring that exemplifies a lot of multiplayer experiences:</small></p>
