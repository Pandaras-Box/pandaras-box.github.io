<h2>“And a bunch of surplus card sleeves… ” - the Editor, on a Productive(?) Tuesday</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> You’re probably wondering, “what does the title have to do with making video games?” Well, for context, David was spending his tea break <span class="text-success">(E.N: Please. Donut break.)</span> 
sleeving cards from a newly acquired tabletop game (more on its particulars in a bit). The game is next in what is now long line of board/card games that have rotated through the Pandara’s Box offices since 
we set up for lunch/post-work “team-building/destroying” sessions. <span class="text-success">(E.N: Get to the point already)</span> In useful terms, I’d like to spend today’s blog talking about how useful 
tabletop games can be in not only gaining inspiration for digital games development, but also are a great way to quickly bring the team together, helping to refocus them.
Before that though, BREAKING NEWS: in an early dose of Blatant Panda-ring this week, we bring some wonderful unexpected news! Our company’s namesake is no longer at imminent risk of extinction. While 
there’s still some strides to go, this is fantastic to hear! <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37272718">bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37272718</a>
We now return you to our (ir)regularly scheduled meandering game development ramblings:<br/>
With tabletop games over the past couple years, we have found that playing a variety of both card and board games has led to the team being much more enthused at work, has helped to improving logical 
thinking across the board, an understanding of how to both work to and subvert expectations, and has also provided encouragement for longer focus in the work day with the incentive of a relaxing session 
of intrigue and backstabbing lined up for the end-of-day. We genuinely think this has been incredibly beneficial (and not just because we have more fun in the workplace!), and the recent addition to the 
office, Coup: Rebellion G54 (or G54, for short), the card game David was found finishing sleeving this morning, has immediately begun to highlight many of these benefits. <br/><br/>

Context first, of course. The base of Coup is a card game (to which G54 is a ridiculously expansive sequel) and a game of deception and strategy, with each player drawing from a pool of 5 different active 
roles (there’s 3 cards of each role) with differing abilities, including superior money gain, information gathering or the power to just plain take others out of the game. The deception comes in the form 
of players performing actions regardless of whether they possess a copy of the role that has that ability in their hand. If opponents believe they are lying, though, their bluff can be called and the player 
in the wrong loses a life (of which they have two). The interactions between the various roles are where the nuance lies, with some blocking others actions and so forth. While Coup contains 5 roles, with 
up to four new replacement roles being added by expansions and promos, G54 contains a whopping 25(!) by default, with another 6 being added by the expansion to that.<br/>
In the base game of Coup, and in G54, characters fall into 4 categories: Finance, Force, Communications and Special, with 2 from the latter and 1 from each of the others in each game. The interactions 
between these roles provide a certain amount of inspiration when it comes to considering the interactions between the various pillars of gameplay within a given project. The additional variety of characters 
in the recently acquired expansion has been especially interesting in suggesting how the variety of stats and abilities in Leitmotif should be balanced with regards to each other - as an analogy to Coup, 
if a Force role is too strong, it can make a Finance role too weak, because they’ll just die before they can use their wealth, or it can make a Communications role too strong as well, because then they 
can just dig for the overpowered role. While this is particularly relevant to our current project, seeing as an RPG features numerous interactions of the sort Coup thrives upon, it is of course only one, 
albeit excellent, example of the usage that tabletop games can be put to when it comes to digital games design. <br/><br/>

With other tabletop games that have found themselves in front of our team, aspects such as co-operative play, the use of RNG (random number generated) elements, difficulty curves/accessibility and depth of 
play have been wonderfully highlighted, leading to otherwise tough decisions in our projects’ development becoming much easier (or the reverse, should a gaping flaw in our original choices be brought to 
light!), all the while keeping our spirits high, especially during the more monotonous periods of development. <br/><br/>

I could go into much more nuance on the particulars of each of these, but it might be more fun if I simply make some recommendations for you all to try if you haven’t already. We at the company usually 
have at least a 4-strong group so bear that in mind for these: King of Tokyo <span class="text-success">(E.N: Be the bigger man… monster)</span>, Avalon <span class="text-success">(E.N: Knights of the Round 
table, if everyone but Merlin was a liar)</span>, Citadels <span class="text-success">(E.N: Property Development Simulator 1700)</span>, Battlestar Galactica <span class="text-success">(E.N: Space the 
frakking toasters!)</span>, Exploding Kittens <span class="text-success">(E.N: Russian roulette with cats, bombs and puns!)</span> and, if you like those, we’ve a bunch more recommendations we could happily 
advise you try out.<br/>
This week’s iteration of Blatant Panda-ring (technically part 2 of it!) features a representation of David’s ritual for trying to get the more productive members to finish up work for the day and shift 
over to the post-work games (today it was my metaphorical desk being bullied) so for your enjoyment <span class="text-success">(E.N: Never say no to Coup!)</span>: <br/>
