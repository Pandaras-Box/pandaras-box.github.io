<h2>Blog 18 AND 19?! Back in the saddle, kind of, clinging on by our boots…</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Back in the saddle, kind of, clinging on by our boots… planning ahead at less than 100% recharged! </h3>

<p><small>After last week’s perfectly reasoned rambling about our time away, and the two weeks before that spent doing the same, we think it’s time to move on, which parallels the situation in the office. 
After taking a couple days to collapse, we focused on getting started on work that took into account the feedback from <a href="https://Twitter.com/EGX">@EGX</a> (I swear that’s maybe the last reference to it). Planning work on the aspects of 
Leitmotif we had received specific feedback on, in particular the tutorial/intro of the game, began in earnest. Once that was complete, work began again as earnestly as possible, but reality is often a harsh 
mistress for self-funded teams, something I think is worth discussing. We also dropped into #PlayMyDemo yesterday (hence this arriving a day late) so I’ll get round to talking a bit about that at the end. </small></p>

<p><small>TL;DR: Recuperation, prologue planning, availability pitfalls & #PlayMyDemo</small></p>

<h3>UNINTENTIONAL HAMMERING HOME OF A POINT (yes the caps was intended</h3>

<p><small>Confused? Thinking “Why is there a title in the middle of the blog?” Don’t worry. Remember last week’s blog, the one that didn’t get published? Yep, that’s all of it. What happened to it, you were 
probably (not) wondering while you went about your week. Well, I had planned to write about how it seemed that our team was dealing with the issue of fatigue after a long stretch with little break, with 
fresher’s flu pouncing right after our return to this fair isle. But no, illness wasn’t my issue last week. The former problem, that of fatigue, seemed to hit me less directly in the form of writer’s block. 
Granted, it may have been as much to do with the excitement of previous weeks leading to current events seeming a little tame, but mostly it was just myself spending a week of days on on-again off-again 
attempts at working on the above paragraph, writing a follow-up sentence, backtracking on it and repeating! I guess it ties in nicely this week as I got to highlight a pitfall I wanted to discuss.<br/><br/>

However, I think it’s for the best I move on, as we’re getting back to a good rhythm in the office now that the team aren’t half (looking more like fully...) dying. I will quickly say that it WAS a good 
evening at #PlayMyDemo last week, I wanted to spend more time discussing it but, alas, I didn’t. Thanks as always to <a href="https://Twitter.com/AngieMcKeown">@AngieMcKeown</a> and 
<a href="https://Twitter.com/Glenndavidson">@Glenndavidson</a> for running it. Was great seeing the other projects too, with <a href="https://Twitter.com/Whitepot">@Whitepot</a>,
 <a href="https://Twitter.com/ItalicPig">@ItalicPig</a>, <a href="https://Twitter.com/Shallow_Sky">@Shallow_Sky</a> and <a href="https://Twitter.com/Mojopinstudios">@Mojopinstudios</a> about to show their 
 new content, along with some <a href="https://Twitter.com/HTCvive">@HTCvive</a> demos and the <a href="https://Twitter.com/ImmersiveTechNI">@ImmersiveTechNI</a> duo on hand to discuss their upcoming plans. 
 I’m going for some lighter content for the rest of this rambling, with some personal interests I’ve found in gaming news over the last while.<br/><br/>

Delighting the designer/developer in me, Medal of the Battlefield’s Duty: Dark Ops 3 (COD: BO3) has finally bucked the trend (6 years absent for the series, 8 if they escape Open Beta, and sadly no longer a 
common addition to games in general) and presented players with Mod Tools and an accompanying server browser. Not only has this helped stabilise the PC player-base, it has presented some wonderful opportunity 
for modders to create new content, and I’m excited to learn the tools, try them out and experiment myself.<br/><br/>

Back over in Overwatch land (or I guess alt-Earth in the 2070s), Halloween has arrived early and, similar to the Summer Games with “Lucio-ball”, a new Brawl has arrived, this time presenting the game with 
its first purely co-op mode, a horde gametype called “Junkenstein’s Revenge”, with 8 characters from the game’s roster acting out the plot of an in-universe B-movie. Fantastic fun, and with a delightful 
learning curve, it’s a great addition to the game, and hopefully indicative of good things to come. They’ve also addressed the one major issue with the Summer Games event - “event loot” can now be bought 
with in-game currency, the lack of which being something that majorly upset some players, who felt it simply a cheap method into making people feel obliged to spend real-world cash on the game, again, for a 
fair shot at the shiny things they wanted. (Which it kind of was, but they’ve offered a compromise, so yay.) Speaking of Overwatch, <a href="http://amomentincrime.com">amomentincrime.com</a> hit 100%, 
and…! … we don’t really know, nothing really seems to have happened.<br/><br/>

Lastly, the official Pokemon Gen 1 fan game (kidding!), Pokémon Sun/Moon dropped its tepidly anticipated demo today (major fan of the series but nothing had truly excited me yet for the new iteration) and it 
has been charming to play so far, more next week as to whether it convinces me to get the full title right away.
Finally, sequel news aplenty (well, two of them, but they’re biggies) with Beyond Good & Evil finally leaving development hell (no joke!) and Red Dead 3 aka Red Dead Redemption 2 aka Red Dead Online + Story 
That Has To Be Prequel (Either that, or Cowboys at Verdun) has its first trailer inbound and after such an extended period of silence on both fronts all appendages are crossed in hope for worthy follow-ups 
to two truly excellent titles. <br/><br/>

I’m going to abruptly end here, because this week, coherence is out, (haha yea, isn’t it always?!) or well maybe it’s just the coffee is kicking in. Until next week, here’s your Blatant Pandaring, with a 
rare brown and white panda:  <br/>
