<h2>24/06/16, a very unexpected series of events… (Europe & the Romeros)</h2>
<p></p> 

<p><small></small></p>

<p ><small >I&#39m still not quite sure that last Friday really happened as I remember. Be honest with me for a second,
did it? The plan this week was to run some bios of our core team, and then maybe end with a joke or two about what a pointless exercise
the EU Referendum was, and, while I&#39ll still do the former, the latter section this week of the blog will be on the lengthier side again!
So, once more unto the breach. </small></p>

<p ><small >So what exactly does the makeup of the Pandara&#39s Box team look like for #Tranzfuser, you might ask (or not, which
is cool too). Well, there are five of us now, having grown solidly for the project from fluctuating between 2-4 at various points in the past. The
obvious one first would be myself, Conall, and I, like a #TF2 pro, am currently wearing multiple hats. As one of the three co-founders of the studio,
I&#39ve taken on the role of team lead for the project, am performing design ideation for combat, am some approximation of a community manager and am also
weighing in on developmental duties. Outside of the project, I&#39ve just wrapped up an MEng Computer #GamesDev degree at <a href="https://Twitter.com/QueensUBelfast">@QueensUBelfast</a>, 
and without boring you much more, have generally been found involving myself in more than too many clubs (and/or societies) in the past few years at the university.</small></p>

<p ><small >Giving the appearance of begrudgingly carrying the entire team on his back with programming know-how is David, the technical
lead for the project as well as sanity checker on these blogs and incredibly smart and handsome and <span class="text-warning">(okay, Conall, I&#39ll stop editing this section now)!
(Editor&#39s Note: I&#39m still the hero you all need. Saving you from the villainy of Sleepy Conall&#39s half-formed thoughts)</span> Graduating alongside myself next week
with the same type of degree from #QUB, as well as being another of the team&#39s founders, David has a wonderful knack of making us fully aware that if he could
type on four keyboards at once he&#39d have this all sewn up with just an artist supporting him, yet we&#39re not mad because he&#39s tricked us into learning new
things. He&#39s a great asset to the team and a strong advocate of teaching us men to fish (mainly so he can get a free fish a day). </small></p>

<p ><small >Adding on to the dos compadres to form the three amigos(/founders) is Dicky, who is very much our creative jack-of-all-trades.
A graduate of Computer Science at QUB, our resident Hong Kong Chinese/Northern Irish (&lsquo;#ChinIrish&rsquo; - Dicky) panda-lover handled sprite art duties on some of
our previous projects (including designing the hero of our well-received mobile title, Slimebow (available on iOS and Android devices now! (#ShamelessPlug))
and performing the role of maestro of music in said projects. With our main artist currently working on concept art, Dicky is on coding and sound asset
creation duties for #ProjectLeitmotif. Side note: his family genuinely run one of the nicest restaurants I&#39ve had the fortune of going to. It&#39s called Dragon
Garden and is situated in Cookstown, Tyrone, so if you ever find yourself in the area it&#39s well worth taking the time to stop in and enjoy (#ShamelessPlug 2:
Delicious Food Boogaloo). </small></p>

<p ><small >The final graduate from <a href="https://Twitter.com/SEEECSatQueens">@SEEECSatQueens</a> (so many letters!) on our team is Ben, joining our team for the first time for
#Tranzfuser. He had been working (and still is part-time) for GAME the past few months and has provided many great anecdotes on the trials of explaining new
titles to the inexperienced buyer. He is currently focused on UI layout design and implementation for the project as well as assisting with other coding duties
as required.</small></p>

<p><small>Last but not least is our unfairly talented artist Ciaran (seriously, check out his work on IrishArtsReview
 <iframe src="https://www.irishartsreview.com/new-generation-artist-work/ciaran-harper/" 
style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true" ></iframe> 
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/harper.gram/"> or here on his Instagram!</a>)to see his final university project work (#ShamelessPlug 3: Rise of the Shameless Plug))
 who graduated this month with a BA in Fine Art from <a href="https://Twitter.com/UlsterUni">@UlsterUni</a>, having a sell-out, prize-winning grad art show to boot. 
Having studied art myself with him back in secondary school, I was aware of his knack for pretty pictures, and frankly envious of his ability to do great work even in 
the space of the bus journey to class! He’ll be rejoining us in the office soon, having been travelling in Asia and all the while gaining inspiration and working on 
concept art for the project, which we look forward to sharing with you all in the future.</small></p>

<p><small>So that’s the team covered, onto last Friday’s shenanigans, which began with the genuinely shocking result of the EU Referendum, which as I’m sure you’re
 all aware was a vote to Leave. While the political fallout is something I won’t attempt to speak on in any great detail, our expertise not being sufficient for that 
 <span class="text-warning">(Editor’s Note: Can confirm, Conall once said the Geneva Convention was the inspiration for Q-Con, and I’m not fully convinced he was joking (or 100% wrong!))</span>, we can 
 speak to the worrying potential ramifications for the local, growing and heavily independent, games development scene both here and in the broader UK.</small></p>
 
 <p><small>It’s become clearer and clearer that basically no-one, on either side of the debate, actually expected this result, and this means that the ‘winners’ 
 apparently haven’t a notion what to do next. This means that, in the case of the video games industry, while we know that many sources of early funding 
 for projects that stemmed from European Union grants/cash injections will dry up, their replacements are, so far, about as tangible as smoke-signals in a fog bank. 
 While, in the short-term, we as a team won’t be hit by these potential negative effects, Friday has presented us, along with the other 19 teams on #Tranzfuser and 
 countless other dev teams, big and small, across the UK, with a rather large new worry on top of the already significant stresses working in the sector can provide. 
 The broader consequences of the vote on both Scotland and Ireland (both sides of the border) going forward is an entirely different kettle of fish that I think I’ll 
 just brush over in favour of talking about the reason Friday rapidly improved.</small></p>
 
 <p><small>Let me set the scene: it’s 9.30AM, Friday. Myself, David and some of the <a href="https://Twitter.com/RedSpearGames">@RedSpearGames</a> folks meet 
 <a href="https://Twitter.com/donalPhillips">@donalPhillips</a> at the MAC in Belfast’s Cathedral 
 Quarter for a workshop for the morning on games development before we are set to attend a series of talks there on ‘Diversity in Games’. The pair set to run
 our workshop: <a href="https://Twitter.com/br">@br</a> and <a href="https://Twitter.com/Romero">@Romero</a> (I am so happy not to be making this up). 
 Naturally, the rest of the day went much better, despite the looming feeling of confusion 
 after the morning’s result.</small></p>
 
 <p><small>Just in case you aren’t knowledgeable about the games industry, (or you are and you’ve been hiding under a rock) these two are the very definition 
 of industry icons. Brenda Romero, formerly Brathwaite, is renowned as a games designer for her work on the likes of the Wizardry and Jagged Alliance series 
 and for her teaching and broader substantial work for the improvement of the industry. John Romero, meanwhile, worked a lot on a few small indie games in 
 the past with one of the startups he was involved with (‘id softworks’ or something?) that went by the names Doom, Wolfenstein and I think “Quack”? Joking 
 aside, he of course is one of the giants of the industry and the advice we received from both him and Brenda was fantastic.</small></p>
 
 <p><small> Beginning with a fantastic segment on forming a good game dev team by way of Black Sabbath and a follow-up with good leaders according to Star Trek from 
 Brenda and a Q&A with them on taking a project to market before the masses (i.e. those other eegits making games locally) were allowed to join in for the 
 ‘Diversity in Games’ part of the day. While I would love to elaborate further on what we discussed in the morning, the closed nature of the morning workshops 
 meant that it left room for the pair to be wonderfully candid at times, but suffice to say it was an ideal way for a room of upstart developers to kick off a 
 Friday, wouldn’t you say David? <span class="text-warning">(Editor’s Note: Don’t talk to the editor, that’s not how this works. Also yes)</span></small></p>
 
  <p><small>The talks in the afternoon, with one on supporting those on the autistic spectrum in gaining employment in the industry, another from John giving a rapid-fire 
 history of the fantastic early days of id Software and the third from Brenda on diversity in the industry in general. Using her refreshingly sensible perspective 
 as someone the press have labelled as a #FemaleGamesDesigner (she prefers, rightly so, #GamesDesigner) is that while people should strive to be great in the industry, 
 she of course she notes role models from various backgrounds are vital. The impression she presented was that we should strive for that being something people can 
 aspire towards without making our background something that defines how they, sharing said background, perform in their role. This was highlighted with John and his 
 Cherokee / Yaqui / Mexican heritage which, while never a focus in his depiction, is something that provides great inspiration to some of those who are fans of his work. </small></p>
 
 <p><small>As a day of insights into the industry from the Romeros, it was fantastic, (though I’m still finding it odd to consider that one of the minds responsible 
 for codifying the FPS genre (such that they were originally called Doom Clones, no less!) moved to Galway of all places!) and a much-needed contrast to the baffling
 confusion the whole EU debacle had presented. </small></p>
 
 <p><small>So that’s this week’s (super) lengthy blog update over with. Next week, well, I think I might hold the topic as a surprise. 
 We don’t want Shigeru Miyamoto’s hostile takeover of Iceland (the shop AND the country (He’d have taken England, but…)) completely derailing a planned topic, 
 or whatever equally unexpected thing we await next) meaning we can’t fully commit to it without providing what is approaching closer to an essay than anything else! </small></p>

<p ><small >TL;DR: Team bios (ish), UK-EU shambles, met Romeros, invasion of the editor</small></p>

<p><small> Gonna try something new to top off this week’s blog: Weekly Dose of Pandas&trade;!
