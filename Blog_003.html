<h2>24/06/16, a very unexpected series of eventsâ€¦ (Europe & the Romeros)</h2>
<p></p> 

<p ><small >I&#39m still not quite sure that last Friday really happened as I remember. Be honest with me for a second,
did it? The plan this week was to run some bios of our core team, and then maybe end with a joke or two about what a pointless exercise
the EU Referendum was, and, while I&#39ll still do the former, the latter section this week of the blog will be on the lengthier side again!
So, once more unto the breach. </small><p>

<p ><small >So what exactly does the makeup of the Pandara&#39s Box team look like for #Tranzfuser, you might ask (or not, which
is cool too). Well, there are five of us now, having grown solidly for the project from fluctuating between 2-4 at various points in the past. The
obvious one first would be myself, Conall, and I, like a #TF2 pro, am currently wearing multiple hats. As one of the three co-founders of the studio,
I&#39ve taken on the role of team lead for the project, am performing design ideation for combat, am some approximation of a community manager and am also
weighing in on developmental duties. Outside of the project, I&#39ve just wrapped up an MEng Computer #GamesDev degree at <a href="https://Twitter.com/QueensUBelfast">@QueensUBelfast</a>, 
and without boring you much more, have generally been found involving myself in more than too many clubs (and/or societies) in the past few years at the university.</small><p>

<p ><small >Giving the appearance of begrudgingly carrying the entire team on his back with programming know-how is David, the technical
lead for the project as well as sanity checker on these blogs and incredibly smart and handsome and (okay, Conall, I&#39ll stop editing this section now)!
(Editor&#39s Note: I&#39m still the hero you all need. Saving you from the villainy of Sleepy Conall&#39s half-formed thoughts) Graduating alongside myself next week
with the same type of degree from #QUB, as well as being another of the team&#39s founders, David has a wonderful knack of making us fully aware that if he could
type on four keyboards at once he&#39d have this all sewn up with just an artist supporting him, yet we&#39re not mad because he&#39s tricked us into learning new
things. He&#39s a great asset to the team and a strong advocate of teaching us men to fish (mainly so he can get a free fish a day). </small><p>

<p ><small >Adding on to the dos compadres to form the three amigos(/founders) is Dicky, who is very much our creative jack-of-all-trades.
A graduate of Computer Science at QUB, our resident Hong Kong Chinese/Northern Irish (&lsquo;#ChinIrish&rsquo; - Dicky) panda-lover handled sprite art duties on some of
our previous projects (including designing the hero of our well-received mobile title, Slimebow (available on iOS and Android devices now! (#ShamelessPlug))
and performing the role of maestro of music in said projects. With our main artist currently working on concept art, Dicky is on coding and sound asset
creation duties for #ProjectLeitmotif. Side note: his family genuinely run one of the nicest restaurants I&#39ve had the fortune of going to. It&#39s called Dragon
Garden and is situated in Cookstown, Tyrone, so if you ever find yourself in the area it&#39s well worth taking the time to stop in and enjoy (#ShamelessPlug 2:
Delicious Food Boogaloo). </small><p>

<p ><small >The final graduate from <a href="https://Twitter.com/SEEECSatQueens">@SEEECSatQueens</a> (so many letters!) on our team is Ben, joining our team for the first time for
#Tranzfuser. He had been working (and still is part-time) for GAME the past few months and has provided many great anecdotes on the trials of explaining new
titles to the inexperienced buyer. He is currently focused on UI layout design and implementation for the project as well as assisting with other coding duties
as required.</small><p>

<p ><small >TL;DR: We&#39re funded to make games, E3&#39s exciting and ending soon.</small><p>

<p ><small >TL;DR: &lsquo;leitmotif&rsquo; </small><p>
