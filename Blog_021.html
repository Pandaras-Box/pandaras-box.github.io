<h2>Costume conundrums in video games, the Halloween blog!</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small>Explosive sounds echo throughout the city, with people running around screaming and faces hidden by masks and hoods… no, not an average weekend in Belfast (circa 1970), it’s just been Halloween! 
Yep, it was the time of year when people adorn the garb of treasured childhood heroes and villains, disguise themselves as current sensations or simply lose themselves within a new persona… but underneath 
they’re exactly the same... right? Aesthetic unlockables (or *scream* DLC) in games are a lot like the changes people undertake over these few days each year then, right? For those of us making the games 
though, how much of an impact do these, generally surface-deep, changes make to the big thing, gameplay?<br/><br/>

So, a festive themed topic for this blog, and one that is all too relevant for developers, especially now that something that was once a running joke about Valve’s Hat Simulator (sorry, Team Fortress 2) 
and early paid DLC (remember the horror of *gasp* Horse armour?!), seems to have become a prominent aspect in almost every major title of late, most notably in F2P and online multiplayer titles. 
Office-fave Overwatch has caused controversy with it, and the allies and foes of Nathan Drake, the Master Chief and Alex “The Numbers” Mason (what DO they mean?) have all kitted themselves out with fancy 
palette swaps, eerily bendy dance moves and, in some cases, more drastic model changes but, broadly speaking, these are entirely superficial. <br/><br/>

From a purely mechanical perspective this is (barring cosmetics that actually change hitboxes) true, but this doesn't actually mean that it can be agreed that play is unaffected. For some, shooting their 
foes with a purple or a pink gun, for example, is no different than its stock grey/beige look, while, to others, that stamp of personality provides at least some additional satisfaction. Access to these 
visual flairs then can become a significant point of contention. Traditionally, cosmetics were unlocked through play, with fancier content earned through a mixture of skill and endurance, or through 
inputting codes, allowing those that knew the secrets of the game access. However, with the advent of microtransactions, cosmetics became the go-to option for additional content that would be locked behind 
a paywall. Initially highly contentious, this became the norm and, particularly in the instances where additional non-cosmetic content was added for free things, seemed to have begun to hit an acceptable 
balance. If players wanted to give themselves an in-game makeover, they could drop some cash and do so, with no hoops to jump through… at least until the broader market started putting F2P tactics into 
full-price games. <br/><br/>

This brings us to the joyful Kinder Surpise-esque satisfaction of mystery boxes/crates/containers, where you open one and you get an assortment of random "loot", generally cosmetic content, of varying 
rarity. Rather than being able to instantly access the specific things they want, players are put at the mercy of the glory that is "Arr En Jesus" (RNG), with numerous bad hauls making the gaining of 
something particularly shiny that extra bit satisfying for some. The AAA model for these crates means that, technically, all content in the game is accessible for free, but none of it is guaranteed, so 
for those players who find the draw of cosmetics to be greater, purchasing additional drops with real-world money can almost seem a necessity. In some cases, players end up finding their main draw to the 
game being earning those drops, and strings of dull drops results in the game in question being abandoned. Not exactly the ideal scenario for the developers, is it?<br/><br/>

Speaking of those developers, or, more specifically, the art monkeys they work alongside, they get lumped with the unfortunate task of making variations on the same thing that continue to look striking, 
interesting and distinct while still trying to retain visual clarity that the end result isn't effectively now an entirely different character, weapon etc. Why is this the case? Well, quite simply, 
you'd have cosmetics veering into gameplay changing elements on a fundamental level… using the trusty Overwatch as an example once more, if the ugly brute that is Roadhog suddenly found himself with an 
unlockable Oompa-Loompa skin, making him a few feet shorter and narrower in the process? It might look hilarious but opposing players would have difficulty ascertaining what they're up against at a glance, 
and those few seconds of delayed recognition make all the difference between winning and losing a fight. This is why we end up with many cases of seemingly "lazy" cosmetics, with the original and distinct 
model silhouette locking the art-team in a corner. If the new visuals seem dull then, once more, players have reason to get frustrated with the system and might lead to the game being abandoned. Again, 
terrible for the developers.<br/><br/>

So it seems we're finding ourselves in a situation where a system that once seemed to be (mostly harmless) fun (back in the early days of TF2's free to play) has become a catch-22 for developers and many 
players. Sure it makes a lot of money, many enjoy the anticipation of opening a surprise and it obsfucates (in the worst case) or removes (in the best case) the issue of players being forced to pay for 
"simple" asset tweaks that, in the past, would have been free. However, if this is going to be at the cost of some players not continuing to enjoy the games that they had been enjoying with friends, if it 
ends up pigeonholing some of the art team into repetitive work and if it costs the more susceptible of us the chance to put money towards genuinely new experiences then the question for those invested in 
the industry for the love of it becomes: is it really worth it in the long run?<br/><br/>

I think I've gone deep enough down this rabbit hole enough for one blog, so happy November everyone, and the team hope you all had a great Halloween, regardless as to whether you spent nothing, a little or 
a lot on hiding your real personas for a day or two! Next time we see you, our American readers will be finalising their deciding on the new Overlord, so, if you're one of them, make sure you vote if 
you're able to. Finishing us off, our Blatant Pandaring for this week ties into our Halloween costume theme, as we're going back to Never Say No To Panda:  <br/>
