  <h2>The Merits of Nostalgia, Embracing the Past for Inspiration (The Return of XXIII)</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p><small> </small></p>

  <p><small>Good week to you all! I've been AFK (Away From Keyboard) for the past few days in preparation of a new venture I'm personally getting involved with,  something I'll delve into at a later time. This unfortunately means we're a day behind this week, a problem compounded by internet issues from the editor, but it does mean that, after enjoying his brief guest section the other week, Dicky (the notorious XXIII mentioned above) had some thoughts he wanted to share which prop up this week's reading with some positive outlooks on past endeavours! :) </small></p>

  <p><small> <span class="text-info">Morning there! Yes, it's me again, with some further words of non-wisdom for another appearance this week, and I have Bioware on the brain!<br> 
So what's the first thing that comes to mind when Bioware is mentioned? Dragon Age? Mass Effect? Star Wars? </span> (Conall: That time they made a surprisingly awesome Sanic RPG?)<span class="text-info"> Well, as much as I'd like to go in depth with a Bioware retrospective, particularly as I consider some of their work absolute works of art, the reason I've actually brought up Bioware is actually not what you may think. Let me get straight to the point. (Conall: Spoilers: he doesn't)
</span><span class="text-info">A couple of days ago, I started up a new playthrough of Mass Effect (Now hooked by it of course), having not touched it in nearly 8 years, with my last playthrough barely making it to the halfway point. Why now, though? Iâ€™ve always wanted to, but never actually, complete a playthrough of the Shepard trilogy </span>(Conall: The Mass Effect games prior to next month's Andromeda - also a huge ME fan)<span class="text-info"> due to other commitments (work, education, other games (of course) etc). I have, however, gone through most of the Dragon Age series (with the exception of finishing Inquisition due to the Frostbite Engine sadly disliking my current setup) and enjoyed it a lot. 
The quality of work that Bioware puts into these games is, in my opinion, fantastic; the story, character depth, world-building and so on. </span></small></p>

  <p><small> <span class="text-info"> Apologies, for I am going off on a tangent. The thing is, while I was contemplating my backlog of games - which is what lead to my return to Mass Effect - over the past couple of weeks I began digging through the mound of old files I'd surprisingly managed to build up over the years. Naturally, I found myself coming across some rather memorable things (as well as a few things I'd rather have kept locked away in the abyss of my forgotten memories!) and these included some concepts/projects I had started up in the early days of my growing interest in games development. Despite keeping them saved, I doubt I thought back then that I would (as I have now) find in them something that would pique my interest, filling me up with enough inspiration and motivation to pick it up again and continue actively working on it in my spare time. 
See, there is a point to all of this rambling. No matter what creative hobby or line of work you find yourself in, don't toss your unfinished projects or concepts (as long as a near equivalent hasn't been coincidentally done successfully in the meantime!) but instead, keep them secrets locked up nice and safe! For no matter how long that backburner keeps them warm, just like going through your old catalogue of games with thoughts like: "Yeah, never really played this properly..." or "Aye, might actually replay this and enjoy it more...", something could spark perhaps, if, like I have, you sporadically gain the notion to revisit old projects/concepts and you could find yourself developing them further into a much improved state. Some ideas might forever remain untouched, but no harm done there. At the end of the day you could end up with something worthwhile and being productive in new ways, that'll not only benefit you but also find you having fun too (Obviously, this is the most important thing). Be it an additional, vital piece for your portfolio, improvement of your current ability or a new set of skills in your CV, it's experience, and that's great. </span> </small></p>
  
  <p><small> <span class="text-info"> Bottom line is, whether you're in a bit of a creative rut like I had found myself in, and the ole' noggin ain't doing you any justice for new ideas, don't be afraid to (re-?)explore your past (as painful as it could be sometimes  </span> (Conall: What aren't you telling us Dicky?!)<span class="text-info">) and maybe you'll find something that might have been just another idea back then but now, with more experience to hand, it could be an amazing one! I don't currently want to reveal what I'm be working on just yet, but keep an eye out for my guest spots in the Pandara's Blog in the near future as I'm sure, if it works out, you'll find out soon.
  Thanks for taking time in reading this blog and have a pleasant day, Ladies and Gents. </span> </small></p>

  <p><small> I also bid you farewell with some themed Blatant Panda-ring from the Deviant Art page of an artist called<a href="http://wallabri.deviantart.com/"> Wallabri</a>, a crossover I never expected honestly!<br>
