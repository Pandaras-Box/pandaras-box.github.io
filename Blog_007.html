<h2>There’s all these musical battles going on, somewhere… the rhythmic world of #ProjectLeitmotif</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> We’re short on time this week, with all hands on deck to get everything sorted ahead of the final fortnight of #Tranzfuser, so we’ll be keeping 
this quite short (and I mean it for once!) this week. I thought it would be interesting to give you all a peek inside the narrative backdrop of #ProjectLeitmotif, 
beginning with a small segment on the creation story of the Leitmotif universe (according to a particularly righteous group within the world), along with a brief 
outline of how the four playable musicians in the current build tie into that lore. <br/><br/>


In the beginning, across all of Nonet, there was the Silence… what followed were the Composer’s opening notes to the overture of existence. From the first stanza, 
Sound had been introduced to the Silence, this greatest of symphonies resonating as the Orchestra of Creation itself. This was led by the Major Instruments, the 
Instruments of the Temporal, the Mental, the Physical and the Ethereal. From these, as the Prelude came to its conclusion, the harmonious strands that formed Tuttia 
entered their opening act. As the Temporal notes reverberated ever outwards, the Major instruments found backing in the Minor families. These lesser instruments consist 
of House Idi, Mem, Cho and Aer, and new embodiments of these were created at the Crescendo of a great culture’s rise to prosperity. The Composer’s Chosen family, 
the Instruments of House Ele, was revealed only to the Virtuosos themselves, the Human race, to guide us to our rightful place as successors to the Composer, in 
Etudia above, by their representatives here on Tuttia, the High Maestro and their Conductors... - from the pages of the Mousiká Biblos, First Maestro’s Revision<br/><br/>

The tale recounted by Project Leitmotif itself takes place during the 23rd Verse of High Maestro Tempo VII’s reign in the twelfth Act. Currently, we have four 
mysterious protagonists who we’ll introduce you to in further detail at a later date. But, for now, we’ll give you a brief description of each of them, along with 
how their role in battles is dictated by their preferred instruments. <br/><br/>

The Dilettante, still unsure of their personal rhythm, finds themselves wielding a simple Tuning Blade, modelled after one of the simpler Minor Instruments of House Idi. 
In the greater narrative, the player’s main party member will begin the game as a character of this class, able to later specialise into one of the other three core 
classes. <br/><br/>

The Neophyte class wields an unassuming Triangle, yet finds themselves able to affect the strands of the very fabric of the Great Composition. Healing wounds and 
harnessing the elements are just the tip of the iceberg of the skills they will learn to master. One opportunity for this class is the potential to specialise, through 
training, to become the equal of one of the High Maestro’s Conductors.<br/><br/>

The Bard finds themselves with a variety of lighter instruments on their person, of particular note their 4-string crossbow, a harp-like weapon that twangs deadly 
melodies towards their foes, but otherwise doubles as their means of earning a top-up to their coffers in the evenings around the campfires.<br/><br/>

Finally, we have the Citheror, wielder of a trusty axe, and a sturdy shield of House Mem slung across their back. Fond of slower, simpler rhythms in battle, they 
find themselves able to deal and take the largest helpings of damage in most fights. This class is an example of a further specialised class, being a heavily armoured 
character with a more specific style of gameplay.<br/><br/>

When it comes to playing the game, the instruments these classes specialise in playing will dictate heavily how the battles are controlled, as Project Leitmotif aims 
to provide players, even through a more traditional control pad, the feeling that they are wielding the same types of instruments their characters are performing battle 
with. Enemies in turn will react and perform differently in battle depending on which ‘House’ of instruments they’re seen to be possessing or dealing with. We’d love to 
delve much further into the lore, but, aside from wanting to hold back plenty of surprises for further down the line, we simply have to get back to work! <br/><br/>

Outside of work hours, all’s been quiet this week, much of which can be attributed to our increased focus on the project outside of the office meaning our downtime has 
been relaxed… I guess we’ve been outside a bit more, forcing David and Dicky to contend with myself, Ben and Ciaran trying to be the very best, like no one ever was! 
<span class="text-success">(E.N: I’ve been considering starting up Ingress to confuse them)</span> Other than that, though, we’ve just been working away and enjoying the relaxation afterwards. <br/><br/>

I guess that wraps things up this week, leaner, musicalier <span class="text-success">(E.N: this is what happens when I let him have free reign) </span> and storier than ever before! 
And, of course, the moment you’ve all been waiting for, this week’s edition of Blatant Panda-ring:  <br/><br/>
