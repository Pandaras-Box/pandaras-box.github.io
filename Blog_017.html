<h2>A second EGX callback, this time less self-centered!</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small>So while this is the 3rd EGX-related update in as many weeks, this is also the 3rd aspect of the show we feel is worth highlighting after covering planning/setup and feedback to our demo. 
Bear with us while we’re beating this dead horse for another encore. EGX then, what’s left to discuss about the 2016 show? Well, the plethora of content that wasn’t us, of course! I’m going to be generous 
<span class="text-success">(E.N: Read: lazy)</span> this week and give Dicky, Ben & David their own guest sections to discuss their personal highlights from the show, something that isn’t at all linked to 
my non-existent writer’s block today, no siree.<br/><br/>

BEN: <br/><span class="text-warning">
EGX 2016 was the first games expo I have been to, and I loved every second of it. From the little shows that some of the games were doing to the professional tournaments going on in the background. 
The main things that stood out to me were:<br/>
Rezzed: The whole area had great games and new IPs that you just wouldn’t see with AAA devs. The developers hung around their stalls, and you could just go up and have a chat with them which was great to see. 
Dawn of War 3: One of the few AAA titles I got to play, and it was a blast. Being a big DoW fan it was great to get a sneak peak at the upcoming title and I'm glad to say I really enjoyed it and can't 
wait for release.<br/>
Final Fantasy XV: I didn’t get a hands-on, but the game looks fantastic and the fans playing were really impressed. Also they had real Chocobos! (Okay, maybe not really ‘real’, but still they win my award 
for best gimmick of the show)<br/>
The Players: I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who played Project Leitmotif! The feedback you all gave us is priceless, and wherever we end up will be thanks to you guys!</span><br/><br/>

DICKY: <br/><span class="text-info">
Having been to Rezzed 2015 before, EGX 2016 would be my second games expo I’ve ever attended, although this is a first for me exhibiting. This time the expo was on a much larger scale than I had ever 
imagined, since Rezzed itself was a section of the overall EGX expo alongside many other sections wherein Triple-A and indie game studios alike proudly exhibit their own glorious creations. As much as I 
would have loved to have sunk my teeth into juicy titles such as Dishonored 2, Sniper Elite 4 and Dawn of War 3 (and countless others), the queues were rather long. Instead, all the time I would’ve spent 
waiting in queue I mostly spent helping at the Tranzfuser exhibition with the rest of the team and going around the Rezzed section instead, chatting to the developers about their journey so far and asking 
for valuable advice regarding the industry. I want to particularly focus on a few of the titles I checked out:<br/>
Signal From Tölva: from Big Robot, the studio behind “Sir, You Are Being Hunted”, is an open-world first person combat and exploration game where the player takes control of drones in an attempt to explore 
and investigate the mysterious signal on the titular planet, Tölva. I’m an absolute sucker for free-roaming, open world games, so I really enjoyed my time on the demo. The quality of gameplay that was 
available in the demo was more than enough to get me to buy it on the first day of it’s release. <br/>
Dead Cells: from Motion Twin, a Bordeaux based French studio. The game is an upcoming Castlevania-inspired roguelike with Dark Souls thrown into the mix, and the animations and art in my opinion were amazing, 
from the dank, brooding architecture to the spell effects and character designs. The fluids animations and responsive controls were a highly satisfying experience, and I haven’t had such a good experience in 
this broad genre since Rogue Legacy. <br/>
Unfortunately I’ll have to end the list here (Sorry to all the other brilliant titles I’ve played and have yet to mention!) as my list would go on for another couple of pages but, since I’ve been instructed 
to “not get too carried away”, I’ll not get carried away</span> (W.N: You got carried away! Welcome to the club...).<span class="text-info">
Most importantly, I would love to thank every person who took the time to try out Project Leitmotif in EGX and for the valuable feedback provided to us!</span><br/><br/>

DAVID: <span class="text-success">(E.N: Assuming direct control)<br/>
Your not-so-humble Editor’s up the plate for this section of the blog this week, here to talk about his experience at his first games expo (just like Ben). The scale of the event was pretty unexpectedly 
huge - the first day, I set out on a half hour excursion to explore as much as possible. In that time, I got through the Rezzed section. As the other writers have hinted at, Rezzed is just one part of the 
entire event, which should give you an idea of the scale we’re talking about. Nonetheless, I managed to take at least a glance at just about everything on display, so I’ll get into the highlights postehaste.<br/>
Unbox: A vibrantly colourful Rare-like 3D platformer with solid movement mechanics and chock-full of character. All of those characters are, befitting the title, cardboard boxes. It’s just that sort of game. 
It was particularly satisfying seeing this game at EGX, just a stone’s throw from our booth, as, just a few weeks before, I’d seen footage of the game and pinged our usual writer as it was exactly the sort 
of game I knew he’d love. At the time, he was hesitant on the idea, but actually getting it into his hands had him loving the experience very quickly.<br/>
Dead Pixels 2: The original Dead Pixels was a masterwork of co-op Beat ‘Em Up zombie slaying action for two people. It was therefore great to find out on the showfloor they’ve improved upon it further for 
the sequel, upping the graphical fidelity, improving the RPG elements to matter even more (sucker for some RPG elements, me) and expanding the multiplayer side of it to not only support more players at once, 
but to allow full online multiplayer, a feature I never knew I wanted from the franchise until now. It was also one of the first things I purchased at the event after talking to the devs (lovely folks!) 
at the booth who, in a refreshing twist, made damn sure I understood that I was buying into it while it was in a demo state, let me know that they were fine if I decided upon hearing that if I wanted to 
change my mind about buying it, and were even willing to help troubleshoot any issues I may have had in redeeming the game.<br/>
Merch: Taking a different tack from the rest of the guys, I’m going to touch on all the wonderful merch at the event. Literally dozens of booths filled with well-known retailers, EGX sponsors and indies 
flogging their own original artwork. It was a perfect breeding ground to fill my need to grab gifts for people back at home, grabbing gaming branded clothing, plushies and even military-themed crafts. All 
told, the shopping (window and otherwise) was an enjoyable way to satisfy the people back home - I even grabbed myself a few things, despite planning to do no such thing!<br/>
Tranzfuser: At the event, the only games I personally played were games developed by Tranzfuser teams (including our own, of course). It was refreshing to see the quality present across all of the teams, 
with a number of original and polished experiences present at the stand. It was also great to see the reaction to our own game, with all interactions with attendees leading to them seeming to love the idea 
of the game, and with plenty of positive feedback being left. To those attendees, I give my thanks.</span><br/><br/>

CONALL: <br/>
I think I’ll steal the format Ben started above too, looking at the sections on show and the highlights across them. For myself, like Dicky, EGX was the second major games expo that I’d ever attended, 
having been with Dicky at Rezzed 2015 in London as Ukie VGAs (Video Game Ambassadors), which, while hugely enjoyable and interesting to attend, was on a considerably smaller scale (around 15K attendees as 
opposed to its bigger brother’s near 80K!) than the expo we found ourselves demoing our own project at. <br/>
Rezzed: Essentially the majority of what we’d seen the year before was now just a fraction of the overall show, but other than containing ourselves and the other Tranzfuser teams there was a plethora of 
interesting content on-show, from the hilarious and entertaining Rare-esque 3D platformer Unbox, the audio-visual treat that was Klang and locally developed Of Kings and Men, which was an awesome sight to 
see, on show too.<br/>
Yooka-Laylee: technically also in the Rezzed section, Playtonic’s wondrous looking buddy-duo platformer and the dev talk we got the chance to drop into (we saw Shovel Knight’s cameo reveal in person! :D) 
continues to excite me to no end, and getting to meet the leads (getting embarrassingly star-struck by Steve Mayles in particular) was fantastic. <br/>
SFV: Condolences to our good friend <a href="https://Twitter.com/Cobelcog">@Cobelcog</a>, Ireland’s top player, who it was was great see play live despite your early exit in the Pro Circuit there.<br/>
The Rest: Outside of the above, I only managed to get trying other Tranzfuser titles (a blog-post in itself to be fair to our co-competitors) and the dual demo of COD: Infinite Warfare & Modern Warfare 
Remastered, the former being a solid follow-up to a game I enjoy greatly (Black Ops 3) and the latter being the classic as I remember it, rose-tinted specs no longer necessary. <br/><br/>

And what do you know, we’ve run out of time once more! Hope you enjoyed a look at the experiences of the team at EGX 2016, as well as the lengthier guest spots from the other 3 from the team who joined 
myself over there. From all of our writers this week, adios for another week! Of course, it wouldn’t be one of our blogs without our Blatant Pandaring: <br/>
