<h2>F2P Vs. Premium: our internal struggle as both developers &amp; players</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> With last week marking (in our minds) the very real beginning of the big push towards the build we’ll be submitting at the end of our 10 weeks on Tranzfuser, we gave you a briefer blog, 
but gave you insight into the growing world of Project Leitfmotif. We’re looking at a very different topic this week, one that should, in theory, be another brief one, as we tackle the questions 
surrounding shifting projects away from the more traditional “buy once” model to that which is held in such high regard by many mobile game developers, Free-to-Play. What’s interesting with this 
debate is how the arguments differ for us now that, as a small development team, making use of one or both models is a very real consideration. <br/><br/>

Before I go any further, a quick summary of what both models are, for those who might be reading this with without such knowledge of the industry. Traditionally, video games have been delivered to 
buyers/players as “Premium” products, i.e. you go into a shop or, more recently, online, select the game you want, buy it and then it’s yours. With this model (in theory - we’ll be avoiding delving 
into the whole DLC debate), the buyer now has access to the complete core package with no further spending required, unlockable content being entirely handled by completing in-game tasks. “Free-to-Play” 
(or the potentially more apt “Free-To-Start”) games are those which for all intents and purposes cost nothing upfront for a user to access and they “can” (in most cases) be played without said user in 
fact ever spending a penny on them… for the most part. In the majority of these titles however, some content is locked off, either by requiring intentionally long periods of grinding to access, or by 
simply unfairly difficult to overcome for the average player. All these cases however, are alleviated through a player’s use of the given game’s currency, which in most cases comes tiered, with an in-game, 
gradually attributed ‘2nd tier’ currency and the ‘1st tier’ premium currency which, for the most part, is gotten through providing the developer real-world money, either via microtransactions or through 
watching adverts within the game. Extra content, power-ups, lives, stamina, even simple cosmetics get accessed through this top tier currency, with big spenders (or “whales”) often being the reason those 
players who spend nothing can continue to play the game for, well, nothing.<br/><br/>

There are many factors that have led to this being a popular yet contentious model for games, from both sides of the virtual counter. It can be considered more accessible, yet in the same instance 
considered cynically unfair, or even manipulative. Most readers will probably find themselves aware of having played at least one of each type of game - sticking solely with mobile, Angry Birds was 
an example of a premium title, while Candy Crush and Clash of Clans follow the F2P model - so very quickly you have some very different senses of the term ‘value’. As a consumer, Angry Birds seems like 
a no-brainer, at the time it cost less than a pound/euro/dollar(/*insert currency here*) and provided a significant number of levels, challenges and replayability. Candy Crush costs nothing up front and 
finds itself with a similar amount of content, but encourages spending with a play limit, such that, unless you are an expert player, you won’t finish every level on your first attempt and, as a result, 
lives disappear quickly, with extended play being either purchased incrementally or requiring long waits. Good for the less committed players, encouraging them to not get lost playing it too much in one 
stretch, but, if you start to look at those with compulsive completionist natures, it can start to seem like an abusive system. Without a continual drip feed of cash, playtime slows to a halt while, with 
the seemingly small purchases - a quick top up here, a short burst there - bills stack up very quickly, exceeding the core price of (in some cases) the price of so-called ‘AAA’ games (the Call of Dutys, 
the Mario Karts and the Halos of the market). <br/><br/>

On the flip side though, many of these F2P games find their lifespans extended by regular, usually free, core content updates. Development of this extra content (which is naturally not free to the 
developer) is funded by the Premium spenders, the “Pay to Play” section of players. This, in the ideal case, leaves money for the team to put back into the community of players they build, enhancing the 
core experience and making the game better all around. There’s also the notion that, well, no-one “has” to spend a thing, and those that do are simply supporting the team that made something they like. 
When you put like that, seems only fair. Doesn’t it? <br/><br/>

Personally, we have found ourselves struggling with where our own loyalties lie on this topic, with most of us having grown up playing fully fledged ‘premium’ releases with plenty of content to sink into 
per purchase. At the same time though, as small developers we realise the huge benefits that taking away an entry fee does towards quickly growing the number of people who can try the work we do. On a 
local scale, we were fit to quickly show people our company’s previous mobile title Slimebow (available now on the Play Store and App Store #ad #ShamelessSelfPromotion), because we’d released a F2P edition 
that was supported by ad banners, getting the game into people's’ hands right away to let them try and enjoy the title, while even a 50 pence price point could be enough to warrant reluctance from the less 
game-enthusiastic folks we know in trying it. Contrary to that, if we make a larger title, we feel a premium price point is required, not only to cover dev costs, but there’s also the less tangible issue 
of some users judging the effort that’s gone into a title based on its starting price. “Oh, well, that game launched under a fiver, so it’s probably short and a bit janky”, which only leads to further 
headaches for us. There are plenty of fair examples of F2P titles of course, just like there are plenty with poorly implemented systems. Naturally, however, the same can be said for Premium titles. There 
are even plenty of titles, especially recently, that combine both models, making working out how to even tackle the debate a debate in itself <span class="text-success">(E.N: Is that Debateception, or is 
it just a Metadebate? Wait, if you answer this, does that make this a Metametadebate? And… oh no, I’ve gone cross-eyed)</span>!<br/><br/>

That last point highlights the whole issue. F2P is a model that originally felt like it was tossed into the market and there was next to no precedence for it, with many rapidly jumping on the F2P hype 
train so to speak before anyone was sure what exactly did and didn’t work with it. So, just like my own thoughts on the issue, it doesn’t really seem to make much sense! After all, a plumber chasing a 
monkey up some scaffolding didn’t make much sense when that concept was first pitched, and that spawned into a well-oiled machine of fun, so hopefully F2P will settle into something similar, a divisive 
but overall beneficial addition to the games market instead of just an excuse to wring every spare penny, dime and eurocent from dedicated players. This week’s blog began discussing the conflict that a 
game-loving, game-making developer such as ourselves can find ourselves facing when considering going for F2P over Premium, but it seems it has become much closer to simply depicting that internal struggle 
through sporadic coherence, rather than hitting the proverbial nail on the head as to what the crux of the issue is… don’t worry, though, you can spend 23 Bamboo Boxes to read on!<br/><br/>
