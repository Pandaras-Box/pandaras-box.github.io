<h2>PSA: Panda's Survival Announcement - Where have the pandas been?! Also: Global Game Jam 2017!!</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p> 

<p><small>Welcome to this week's blog guys!!</small></p> 

<p><small>Wow... so did anyone buy that...??  </small></p> 
<p><small>Nope? Ok. Well this is the apology part *Deep Breath&trade;*: <br> Sorry for the silence these past *checks calendar* 2 MONTHS?!, umm 
well, frak, that's been longer than we'd hoped! I'm without my trusty editor today so I'll go into detail back at our usual Tuesday slot this week as to the whys and whynots etc...
But for now? We've, as a team, had a variety of things we've each had to sort (was that vague enough? I think it was!)</small></p> 
<p><small> WELCOME TO OUR NEW WEBSITE!!<br> The above caps locking has probably highlighted that this adhoc blog has a few more pressing matters we wanted to bring to your 
attention on this surprisingly sunny Saturday. The words in caps themselves probably giving away one such matter. Yes, that's right, no more Twitlonger! (Though big thanks to that 
site for putting up with my nonsense last year) I (still Conall) finally got around to throwing this vaguely acceptable, suitably colour-themed, home for our content over the 
Christmas period in a bid to create a true, safe home for our ramblings (and soon our games too, because that's what we do I swear!) as well as a means by which you all can handily 
access past content without trawling through Social Feeds for the links! As of my writing this, I've neatly archived our first 5 (and this) blogs, though that will rapidly increase 
to the total 22 and counting + other cool content we have planned.</small></p> 

<p><small>GLOBAL GAME JAM 2017 IS HERE! <br> (Yea... I'm abusing the lack of Editor in this edition a little bit, normal services resume with Blog 23!)<br>
The other reason I've looked for your attention is that, this weekend (as of last night in fact), I'm repping the Pandas at the Belfast hub (at 
<a href="https://Twitter.com/farsetlabs">@farsetlabs)</a>. <a href="https://Twitter.com/GlobalGameJam">@GlobalGameJam</a> is a fantastic, annual event where the whole world simultaneously has a theme, 
this year it IS: (oh yea, I'll tell you all in the next one, some timezones may not know yet!), and with said theme 48 hours are allowed to make a game based on it! I'm working in a team with 
a pair of friends who're trying a jam for the first time, brave lads have jumped in the deep end! The hub in Belfast is currently filled with nearly 100 developers and artists, kindly organised 
by the lovely folks at Farset (of note, thanks Angie, Glenn, Claire & any others I may have missed... also yay! NIScreen are feeding NI's developers again! Brilliant folks they are...). Looking 
round the hub last night I spotted a mixture of newcomers and those friendly faces from the likes of BillyGoatEnt, Italic Pig, WhitePot, CoffeeBox etc that are involved so often with the local industry.
</small></p> 

<p><small>Later in the week I'll be uploading our 23rd blog, Dicky will have a special guest appearance as a result. Otherwise the blog will provide proper explanation for our silence, 
and as well too talk about what I ended up with after #GGJ17 and maybe even a breakdown of some of the more notable projects from other teams at the Belfast hub! Then, potentially in the following Blog,
 our plans for going forward (as well as intentions to expand upon this shiny new toy I've built) will be laid out in more concrete detail. I'm getting dirty looks from my co-jammers here
 for having a text editor and not Unity open before me, so bye for now(I swear it won't be another 2 months til next time)!</small></p>

<p><small>TL;DR: Proper explanation inbound, website, GlobalGameJam 2017!</small></p>
