<h2>&#34;Stay on target!&#34; - Gold 5, Star Wars (aka #Tranzfuser mid-project ramblings)</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small></small></p>

<p><small>You’ll be pleased (we hope you will be, at least, but maybe you’re just here for the excellently 
written <span class="text-success">(E.N.: and edited!)</span></a> blog content) to hear that this week we’ll be talking in some greater depth about #ProjectLeitmotif.
 We’re approaching the halfway point of the project, with this being our 5th week. As a result of this, we have a mid-project review 
 to deliver to the lovely folks over <a href="https://Twitter.com/UKGamesTalent">@UKGamesTalent</a>. So, what better time to catch everyone else up to speed than the week that we 
 have to take stock of our progress anyways? We at Pandara’s have always been advocates of that whole two stones one bird stuff. 
 (A quick aside however - David, you missed some blatant proofing errors last week. 50 points from Ravenclaw! <span class="text-success">(E.N.: And you put 
 them there in the first place, so twice as many points from Gryffindor.)</span>) </small></p> 
 
 <p><small>As a brief overview of where the project is at, we’ll begin by looking at the core elements we’ve been working on.
 In the design corner, we have locked down the world building (general narrativey stuff), the broad strokes of the core combat loop
 (the nitty gritty of how you hit people), the combat menus (all those shiny buttons that let you hit people), the combat UI 
 (those beautiful pictures that let you see what’s going on), stats systems (the stuff that lets you know just how hard you’re 
 smacking that monster in the face), menu navigation, concepts designs for player characters, enemies and some fun combat settings, 
 and exactly how the rhythm handling logic works. At this point, our design focus is on our continued experimentation with a variety 
 of control schemes and combat implementations.</small></p>
 
 <p><small>On the artistic front, we have Ciaran working away on as wide of a variety of concepts as he can for the aforementioned player,
 enemy and setting designs. The main source of inspiration for these designs comes from a blend of the hand-drawn look of the likes of 
 Okami or Muramasa: The Demon Blade mixed with the styles of Ancient Graeco-Roman artwork (such as those present on their pottery) and 
 a smattering of influences from the Thai and Cambodian backdrop of his current travels (from which he returns from this week!). 
 Elsewhere in the realm of asset creation, Dicky has been devoting some of his time to creating the audio necessary to go with our rhythm logic.</small></p>
 
 <p><small>Speaking of logic, much of our time over the past few weeks has been spent on the development and implementation of the engine itself. 
 Our major focus has been on getting a flexible system built to cater to our needs for a robustly extensible rhythm creation and matching system 
 to tie in with the musical aspects of our combat system. This is something that David, our Development Lead <span class="text-success">(E.N. And editor, don’t forget the 
 &#34;and editor&#34;)</span> has taken point on, and now has in great shape. Surrounding that, we have the structure of the backend for our stats 
 system implemented, the core combat &lsquo;phases&rsquo; functional (with the combat loop in each phase now entrenched in the experimentation stage), 
 the external navigation menu (for getting around the parts of the system) ready to go and our intuitive in-combat menu system nearly ready. </small></p>
 
<p><small> Across the first 4 weeks we carried out 3 Sprints. We started with an initial pair of one-week long sprints and followed that with a two-week sprint,
 which lead to the start of this week. By the end of the first sprint, we had narrowed our initial concept from a combat system and an exploratory 
 side-scrolling platforming wrapper and a functioning overworld design, to simply cover the prototyping of the combat system itself (what’s the antonym of scope-creep?).
 To go into more detail, the first sprint covered predominantly conceptual work, with the stats systems, art assets, battle ui and defensive phase 
 of combat all mapped out. After that, we spent the second sprint developing said stats system, getting a functional build of the pattern creation 
 and rhythm matching logic ready, recording some placeholder sound assets and functionally building the battle UI itself. Finally, in the last, 
 most recent sprint, we had a rough wrapper menu system designed and built, the rhythm logic system refined and extended to a point we were happy 
 with and the battle UI developed and ready to be merged in with said rhythm system.</small></p>
 
 <p><small>Across the rest of the programme, there are a number of key milestones we intend to achieve. Initially, we plan on integrating
 all of our current system components, which we hope to have completed by the beginning of week 6. Following that, we intend to continue 
 to experiment with the core combat phases (Attacking, Defending and using Abilities), something we aim to have locked down by week 7. 
 At the same time as this, we intend to begin in earnest the integration of the art assets Ciaran has been working on, an ongoing iterative 
 process of which which we aim to have the bulk of completed going into week 8. While this is going on, some of the team will be focused on 
 implementing and balancing the various combat participants and abilities. Our intention is then to spend the final two weeks minimum simply 
continuing to refine and polish the prototype ahead of the final build in preparation for prime time. </small></p>

<p><small>I think the one key thing that should be highlighted from this whole process to date is how we&#39ve had to react to planning vs. 
reality when it comes to scope. Despite going into the project with (in our minds) a significantly reduced scope compared to our 
plans for our overall project to cover the 10 weeks, it has rapidly evident that our key hook, the rhythmic combat system, was more
than enough to work on over the time period for #Tranzfuser. Across the whole prototype it has become clear that shaving off the 
excess to focus on making the core aspects as good as we are capable of was not only a necessity to develop them, but also hugely 
beneficial to the quality of the result. This might sound simple, and we might all be aware of it, but reminding ourselves of it regularly can only be a good thing. </small></p>

<p><small>The last section ties nicely in with how I’m closing out this week’s blog, as no week during the project has highlighted 
the need to scale and plan for issues appropriately as much as this. Having had a flu-like plague traverse the office (having been kindly 
delivered by <a href="https://Twitter.com/RedSpearGames">@RedSpearGames</a> miscreant <a href="https://Twitter.com/Ghostlyy">@Ghostlyy</a>), we had first Dicky, then Ben and finally David briefly out of sorts in week 4. 
Fortunately, since their fingers weren’t affected, they were still able to progress with their work <span class="text-success">(E.N.: You slavemaster.)</span>. 
This week however, we had the wonderful situation crop up wherein we were recording footage for our review and I was unable to 
physically speak in any understandable manner, with the symptoms having finally caught up with me <span class="text-success">(E.N.: Karma’s so much fun)</span>. 
To really showcase just how lucky I am as a person, I hit the worst part of it during my usual timeframe for writing these blogs! 
This, combined with myself and David graduating on the Wednesday (congrats also to the <a href="https://Twitter.com/RedSpearGames">@RedSpearGames</a> team for joining us with our 
MEng Computer Games Dev degrees), meant that, had we not already covered most of the planning, scripting and editing for the review 
well ahead of time, we would have been just a teensie little bit extremely worried about having it all put together on time. 
As it is, we simply had to record the last segment once my voice returned, and to then slot it into the video. Sadly, this did mean 
we did end up having to knock publishing this blog back by a couple of days, but regular service will be resumed by next week of course.</small></p>

<p><small>As always, thanks for reading, and, hopefully, you’ll find the content interesting once more.
 Although, if you didn’t… here’s week 2 of our “Pandas in Motion” content (this is by no means intended as a distraction…)

<p><small>TL;DR: Halfway there (living on a prayer), work work work, the plague, graduation, excuses</small></p>
