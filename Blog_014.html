<h2>Venturing to other realities, the Virtual & the Stop-Motion… For Research!</h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small>In the past week, while we’ve made some cool tweaks and changes to the project, major discussion of the changes probably wouldn’t be of much interest to you all so, instead, I think it’s only 
smart to focus the blog this week on the more interesting aspects of our work over the past few days. Over the past weekend, the bulk of the team found themselves assisting in promoting 
“That-Building-Where-We-Work” or, as it’s more properly known, the Computer Science school at QUB, as it was the university’s Open Days (I swear our work there was relevant!). Then, last night, the whole 
team headed for some genuine post-work research at the cinema.<br/><br/>

Open Days, though, how are those relevant? Well, the staff thought it made the most sense to stick the in-house games folks around the building to chat about our experiences with the degree to the high 
school final years and their parents, mostly in the most logical place of all: surrounded by VR headsets, arcade cabinets and Steam machines! While the latter is nothing new, the arcade machines are pretty 
damn cool, and there was a large range of titles available, from the 16-bit machines, with the likes of Donkey Kong and Pac-Man, to the fancier multi-hundred strong cabinet with most of the 32-bit classics, 
including FAR too many iterations of Street Fighter II! <span class="text-success">(E.N: Speaking of nothing new, hello retro)</span> It was the VR access that made the largest impact on us however, with the 
full range of quality on-hand.<br/><br/>

What does “Full range of quality” mean? On display were two iterations of Google Cardboard, one literally made of cardboard (albeit with some lenses) and one plastic model with fancy padding and a more 
adjustable setup (this technology works like a pair of goggles - Google Goggles would have been a better title - where you slot a phone in with some VR stuff running, and it handles the visuals), the 
Oculus Rift DK2 (from a couple years back) and the recently released HTC Vive (which includes Wiimote-esque controllers and “Lighthouses” - spatial sensors that work out where you are in the room). The 
Cardboard and Oculus we’d tested before, both of which are excellent at doing what they were intended for but it was the first time any of the team had experienced VR on the level of the Vive, with the 
addition of a greater degree of tracking (controllers, sensors etc on top of the headset) adding to the immersion. How did we find it? Frankly astonishing. VR has leapt in viability by leaps and bounds 
over the last couple years and with the Vive, it seems to have finally stepped past one the hurdle which could have crippled it for first person experiences, motion sickness. <br/><br/>

Way back in the last ‘era’ of VR, during the 90s when the likes of the VFX1 was available and Nintendo were crippling themselves with Virtual Boy bombing, a major issue was that VR was not something the 
majority of players could handle for significant periods of time. Players got ill in some respect after lengthy periods of time owing to a number of factors, including as the low resolutions (due to the 
need for drawing two different versions of the screen at once and the limitations of the technology at the time) and the dissociation of their movement/actions in game and (lack of) their movements in real 
life causing the body and mind to get confused. Newer devices, such as the aforementioned Oculus, had made strides towards fixing some of these issues, with the higher quality imagery combating the low 
resolution problems, and, with some experiences, opting for non-first person camera perspectives to remove the disassociation problem. Both of these were present in the Oculus game we were demoing, 
Edge of Nowhere (by <a href="https://Twitter.com/Insomniacgames">@Insomniacgames</a>), which stuck to an over the shoulder third person perspective, meaning the issues found in the numerous 1st person 
VR titles were largely avoided, including that uncanny sense of “wrongness” felt when your head sees your “body” moving but your body feels no such thing.<br/><br/>

A number of titles on the Vive completely dodge those bullets via another solution. One of the games we had access to, and the that sold it to us and the hundreds of students we demoed the device to, 
was HordeZ. As a title, this game is a relatively simple on-rails “Left4Dead-alike” first person shooter, but it an amazing example of both VR’s newfound viability in the wider market and of it’s ability 
to significantly add to the depth of an experience, which caused it to easily be the best experience we on the team have had with VR. People have talked for years about how “VR is the next big step in 
immersive gameplay” in the industry (and in media in general), but this was the first time where it genuinely felt like that next step. We had everyone, from lecturers, PhD students, schoolkids, parents 
and their little siblings trying out the tech, and very few took off the headset without a look of wonder and shock upon their face. Some of those who played longer were genuinely thrown by their ‘return’ 
to another place, having been very far away up to the moment the visor was raised. <br/><br/>

So what is it that made this game “click”? Every aspect felt like it was built to make you feel like a badass zombie slayer. Standing within that 3x3x3m cube, players had full freedom to raise their equipped 
weapons individually, brandishing them in any direction and at any height (the sensors work together with the headset to track the player’s head location, while the controllers work with them to track the 
hands) and angle. Intuitive, streamlined controls (pull trigger to fire, squeeze the controller to reload and an easy dial for weapon swapping) added to the feeling, with the SMG and pistols giving a sense 
of control and immersion (pistol felt like it had weight behind hit, while the SMG sprayed perfectly, like a hose for bullets). It may sound like I’m gushing, but, once you see some of the footage we’ll 
likely be posting later in the week (to embarrass the team, naturally), you’ll see it in action! <br/><br/>

Both the Oculus and Vive are accessible for the students to develop on, and, after that weekend, we ourselves are very excited at the chance to play around with the tech, our eyes now truly open to the 
potential of this returning innovation. I did make a point of mentioning the cinema, so I’ll progress to to that now, because I think it’s likely the idea that we now like VR is quite clear! <br/><br/>

Kubo and the Two Strings, about a young musician who wields a string instrument to channel magic in a feudal world. Sounds familiar, somehow. On the surface, trailers suggested we had found a movie 
following the same train of thought as our game’s lore, so we (combined with it being another beautifully animated release from Laika) thought it would best to go see how that was tackled on the big 
screen. In the end, the musical focus was a lot more reserved than we had anticipated, but some of the visual flourishes won’t be forgotten in a hurry. <br/><br/>

Ignoring its connection to our own needs and inspirations, it was a wonderful movie, darker (as Coraline and the likes were before it) than the visuals may initially have implied, but fantastically 
realised. The plot may have played second fiddle to the realisation of character beats, and the pacing occasionally felt a little off, but this tale of a one-eyed boy, his instrument and his travelling 
companions (that included copious amounts of origami and Matthew McConaughey, beetle-man) were a joy to watch. Coming out, we all found ourselves noting that key action beats leant themselves to feeling 
inspired by boss battles from the likes of many great action RPGs, with Dark Souls, Zelda and Elder Scrolls all immediately springing to mind, but, thankfully the animation and direction team leapfrogged 
over the common mistake of framing the action too much like those very games, instead expertly using the format to it’s fullest potential. <br/><br/>

So, for sure, Pandara’s Box would wholeheartedly recommend a visit to see Kubo, and we are enthused by a well-received example of a musically-defined fantasy action experience. Oh, and did we mention 
that VR is pretty damn cool now?! Next week will be the day before EGX, so expect some panic-induced ramblings as we triple-check our preparations again for the exciting week ahead. Until then, we’ll 
leave you with some animated Blatant Panda-ring as our send off this week, so blink now while you still have the chance, for a great tale awaits you (- Kubo)!  <br/>
