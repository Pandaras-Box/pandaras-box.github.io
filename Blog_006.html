<h2>Pandara’s on tour (Red Spear in-hand!) to Develop: Brighton & discussion on intuitive inputs and art direction… </h2>
<p></p>

<p><small> </small></p>

<p><small> Last week the idea of “Pandara’s Box on tour” was mentioned, coined by David and his meddlesome edits <span class="text-success">
(E.N: Careful now.)</span>. Of course, what this actually meant was that I, along with Red Spear’s Matthew Lagan
(<a href="https://Twitter.com/Ghostlyy">@Ghostlyy</a>), travelled over to the wonderfully sunny Brighton for 
<a href="https://Twitter.com/developconf">@developconf</a>. While trying to regurgitate verbatim our muddled, half-forgotten and mutated 
versions of the full contents of each talk we attended is probably not going to benefit anyone, the roster provided some very interesting 
key talking points to touch upon. Back here in the grey dimness of Belfast (home sweet home), debates are building over how to take our structurally 
sound (heh (E.N: down with this sort of thing.)) mechanics and sprinkle some much needed creative spark into how players interact with them. Meanwhile, 
with the jet-lag clear and enthusiasm high, Ciaran (<a href="https://Twitter.com/_charper">@_charper</a>) has been making great strides in locking 
down the art direction of the project.<br>
 
Let’s give some input on Input (heh (E.N: sigh.)) first, however, as this is the latest noggin’ nuisance we’ve been facing in the office. 
While we are still confident in the core base of the game, we don’t want to rest on our laurels when there is still untapped potential in how 
players interact with that base. This is something we’ve decided to spend some time experimenting on following a recent meeting with our local 
#Tranzfuser hub, <a href="https://Twitter.com/NIScreen">@NIScreen</a>. Why should we polish our prototype towards being “fun”, when it could be FUN? 
An interesting debate on design arises out of this new focus though, as, while a control scheme by definition can be new or a fresh application of 
an existing control scheme or input device, and while it may even be fun to do so, another factor, namely how intuitive it is, has a huge impact 
in defining how far things can be pushed before going too far. A great example (and thematically relevant) is Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat, a 2D 
platformer controlled by… bongos. Yes, bongos. It is in fact a fantastically designed, fun and unique title but, while players are not technically 
required to own and use the bongo peripheral, not doing so strips the title of most of it’s uniqueness and, in doing so, impacts the quality. This 
creates an interesting scenario wherein the game has a significant entry barrier of cost, learning and availability to access the game, but, for those 
who overcome it, the title is near universally praised.<br>

Now, while we don’t plan on shipping our game with a custom controller, we (and, of course, many other devs making something with less traditional 
styles of gameplay) still have the dilemma when experimenting with control schemes of how far they can reasonably push into the new with neither the 
learning process nor extended play becoming arduous. Conversely, the satisfaction from producing a system that hits the right balance far outweighs 
the risk in our books. <br>

Onto <a href="https://Twitter.com/developconf">@developconf</a> then, a hugely informative (and, quite frankly, exhausting!) trip for myself and Matt. 
The decisions over who could afford to go, how we’d travel etc got knocked back a tad due to our teams’ graduations the week prior meaning the only 
practical option ended up being a truly glorious 3AM start(!!!) on Thursday morning. Roughly speaking, a brisk 25 minute walk saw us to a 45 minute 
bus, followed by an 80 minute wait (the only notable ‘delay’ so to speak of the trip), then a 110 minute flight into a 20 minute walk followed by a 
35 minute train and a final 15 minute walk through Brighton leaving us (contrary to our predicted 15 minutes late) early for our start to the day, 
a complete shock to us, coming from the “ever-reliable” notion of transport provided by Translink! This start included, courtesy of the lovely folks 
at @UKGamesTalent, a free stream of coffee and some tasty breakfast as part of a networking session for the attendees who were also partaking in 
#Tranzfuser (it was great to meet you all, don’t let our exhausted fugue states fool you! (E.N: really, it’s just like meeting him any other day of 
the week)). This session gave myself and Matt time to catch our bearings before scooting off to the main purpose of our trip, the #IndieDevDay at 
Develop, a few minutes away from the initial breakfast.<br>

Credit must be given right off the bat to the speakers of the six talks we attended throughout the day as, had they not been as engaging about their 
given topics as they were, I’m not sure either of us would have been so attentive as we were, having begun the day of talks having been awake for 24 
hours with just 1 asleep! To kick things off we had “To VR or Not to VR”, a panel of devs discussing the topic of VR and coming to the conclusion that 
VR maybe should be looked into, or maybe not, or I guess at some point, with everyone agreeing that this fantastic new tech was just too early into 
it’s infancy for us devs to fully understand yet how to best use it. This led into James Parker’s incredibly useful talk regarding the realities of 
porting titles to consoles from his experiences at <a href="https://Twitter.com/GroundShatter">@GroundShatter</a>, their team having ported a PC title 
in the recent past that contained an online multiplayer element and discovering a HUGE increase in work required there. From our own perspective, it 
was a particular interesting talk (certainly <a href="https://Twitter.com/RedSpearGames">@RedSpearGames</a> have a good deal to think about regarding 
that networking hurdle). While it is something we currently have no plans to need to worry about in our project, with our local-play focused plan, 
even simple things like taking into account each platform’s equivalent to achievement systems is a logistical point that we’ll certainly be keeping 
in mind. <br> 

After lunch, the sessions continued with a talk that enthused <a href="https://Twitter.com/Ghostlyy">@Ghostlyy</a> and myself by 
<a href="https://Twitter.com/JessHider">@JessHider</a> from <a href="https://Twitter.com/EpicGames">@EpicGames</a> concerning the wide variety of 
support they offer to devs outside of simply providing a cool engine (<a href="https://Twitter.com/UnrealEngine">@UnrealEngine</a>) to make games 
within. Before the talks closed out with a panel on succeeding with PC and console, <a href="https://Twitter.com/SimoRoth">@SimoRoth</a> provided a 
(certainly often argued) viewpoint on crunch in developing games, something we ourselves do try to avoid. However, his view that it could never be 
something needed, while of course intentionally idealistic, was something many in the room found hard to concede to. Wrapping the evening up was a 
session called #AskRami (yes the same <a href="https://Twitter.com/tha_Rami">@tha_Rami</a> who hails from 
<a href="https://Twitter.com/Vlambeer">@Vlambeer</a>) and it was a great way to wind down for the evening (the Q&amp;A session should be on 
YouTube and is worth having a look at). Overall, the day saw us introduced to a number of interesting industry people and had us come back to our 
teams with plenty of juicy tidbits of gossip and advice to relay and improve our dynamics going forward. <br>

As a quick callback to last week… Ana, <a href="https://Twitter.com/PlayOverwatch">@PlayOverwatch’s</a> upcoming support sniper (no, that isn’t a 
contradiction) is another (free, of course) fantastic addition to the game. Additionally, we talked <a href="https://Twitter.com/Beeteeh">@Beeteeh</a> 
(he jumped ship from PS4 to PC) and <a href="https://Twitter.com/Thierymodela">@Thierymodela</a> into the light! Thanks once more for the read, and, 
of course, here’s a 4th helping of blatant Panda-ring: <br>
