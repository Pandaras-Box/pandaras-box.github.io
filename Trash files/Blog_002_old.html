<span class="s1"><b>Let&#39s talk #ProjectLeitmotif a bit
(& some @Qub_QCon, video game movies)</b></span></h1>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So we&#39ve After clearing up last week how exactly we&#39ve risen from the ashes (of university) with
#Tranzfuser, I think it&#39s fair that we fulfill our plan from last week, that of of discussing, at least a little bit, the title we&#39re
working on for the programme. Its working title, as seen in the title above, does give away one key aspect if you know the word &lsquo;leitmotif&rsquo;
means. If not, I&#39ll let the Oxford Dictionary handle this one: Leitmotif - A recurrent theme throughout a musical or literary composition,
associated with a particular person, idea, or situation. For our project, it is the musical application we&#39re focused on, with audible
leitmotifs being a key aspect of the battle system we are currently prototyping.  </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To compare our prototype to things you may already know, Project Leitmotif could be seen as what would happen
if you took the battle system from Paper Mario, tossed in the musical gameplay of Guitar Hero, and then blinded that concoction with the same
radioactive waste that the young Daredevil and the Baby Normal Untrained Turtles were so fond of. PL, then, is a musically inclined turn-based
combat system where listening will take point amongst your senses as you play. The core system of play, that of an active turn-based combat
system, contains some of the interactions added to the likes of the aforementioned Paper Mario, that of button presses when presented with a
visual cue, but with a fundamental twist. Instead of reacting to visual cues, depending on the situation (attacking, defending, supporting etc)
players will be reacting to audio cues - which is where those leitmotifs come in - in a variety of fun ways. These interactions are what we will
be tweaking and experimenting with for the next few weeks, having spent the past couple laying the necessary groundwork for that to happen.
We&#39re very excited to be so close to showing off the system in the near future.</span><p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similar to last week, the rest of the blog is devoted to our goings-on outside of working hours. The weekend
just past saw this year&#39s return of <a href="https://Twitter.com/QUB_QCon">@QUB_QCon</a> and, while we didn&#39t make a return to the #indiedev gazebo, alongside the likes of
<a href="https://Twitter.com/BrainandNerd">@BrainandNerd</a> and <a href="https://Twitter.com/OutsiderGames">@OutsiderGames</a>, myself and David did find ourselves assisting the 
staff of <a href="https://Twitter.com/SEEECSatQueens">@SEEECSatQueens</a> (OMGWTFLMAOBBQ guys shorten your Twitter handle
once you move to the new building ok?) in running the building throughout the weekend. We had the <a href="https://Twitter.com/Oculus">@Oculus</a> being 
demoed alongside <a href="https://Twitter.com/insomniacgames">@insomniacgames</a> atmospheric new title <a href="https://Twitter.com/edgeofnowherevr">@edgeofnowherevr</a>, as well as occasional spontaneous outbreaks of board games and the #QCon guys running the #CSGO
tournament upstairs. The lecture hall was hijacked to run a variety of games on the big screen when it wasn&#39t being used for livecasting said
Counter Strike games (big shoutout to Phil for surviving the cast of the final). I can certainly attest to the exhaustion of members of our own
team as well as a substantial proportion of the <a href="https://Twitter.com/Redspeargames">@Redspeargames</a> and <a href="https://Twitter.com/coffeeboxgames">@coffeeboxgames</a> 
(that #gamedev wot <a href="https://Twitter.com/bellulargaming">@bellulargaming</a> is part of yea?) teams, though,
as usual, it was an excellent weekend - no surprise for a successful con 22 years young! </span><p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, our artist recently got to visit #AngkorWatTemple in Cambodia, a beautiful site featured in
Angelina Jolie&#39s 2001 Lara Croft: Tomb Raider movie. We&#39re all intrigued to see how the excellent Alicia Vikander carries that particular mantle,
especially now that we&#39re in a relatively positive time for video game adaptations. We also have Michael Fassbender reuniting with his
well-praised Macbeth team on the way with Assassin&#39s Creed, and the resounding success that <a href="https://Twitter.com/ManMadeMoon">@ManMadeMoon</a> has 
had with <a href="https://Twitter.com/Warcraftmovie">@Warcraftmovie</a> can&#39t be ignored. While the US ignored it, the rest of the world appear to have enjoyed it a considerable amount. Certainly, Dicky found it very
enjoyable (the die-hard <a href="https://Twitter.com/Blizzard_ent">@Blizzard_ent</a> fan of our team) and, a few pacing and casting decisions aside, I found it spectacular. The film fully
embraces its genre, which works in achieving exactly what it sets out to do, so, if you&#39re a fan of traditional fantasy, ignore the reviews
and you&#39ll find it to be a truly fun Fantasy experience with truly astonishing visuals throughout.</span><p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That&#39s it for Pandara&#39s Box second, and thankfully more succinct, blog. Next week, we will talk about who we have
on the team for #Tranzfuser, and what roles they&#39re juggling for the project.</span><p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">TL;DR: #ProjectLeitmotif is a musical turn-based battle hybrid. Footage Soon&trade;. Q-Con&#39s still excellent.
Video game movies getting better?</span><p>
